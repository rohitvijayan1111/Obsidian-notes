### Give me an example of a time you had a conflict with a team member. How did you handle it?

#### My Response:
>One of the instance thaat i could think of where i had a conflict with a team member of mine, was during the development of the project that we had been developing for the smart india hackathon. a short description about the project it is an application that is designed to create annual reports for the institution. So we started with data collection etc using forms. We wanted to showcase analytical details about the data that we have got to make informed decision . so i insisted my teamate that we need to add one such feature. They told that we could statically add 3-4 graphs. I felt that an application should dynamic interaction and must allow users to create KPI of their needs. They said it would be difficult and it is a topic that is diverting from the problem statement. however i felt this was an game changer, so i concieved my teamates i would develop an module for that. using Ai (gemini) i was able to get input from the user as a text (normal but it should contain description about the table and i.e column in a high level) and on passing the prompt the graph would be added to the users dashboard

#### Structured Response:

>    **Situation:**  
	During the Smart India Hackathon, my team and I were developing an application to generate annual reports for an educational institution. One of our goals was to collect data using forms and present it effectively.
>	
	**Task:**  
	We needed to design the data presentation module. I proposed adding a dynamic analytics dashboard to allow users to generate custom KPIs and visualizations, while one of my teammates preferred using a few static charts, believing the dynamic feature was too complex and possibly outside the scope of the problem statement.
>	
	**Action:**  
	To resolve the disagreement, I acknowledged their concerns and proposed taking full responsibility for the feature as an independent module. I leveraged AI tools (specifically Gemini) to build a component that accepted natural language prompts to describe the table and graph requirements. The system then rendered corresponding charts on the userâ€™s dashboard, enabling dynamic interaction without affecting the rest of the app's development.
>	
	**Result:**  
	The feature became a highlight during our final presentation and impressed the jury. It contributed significantly to our team winning the competition. The experience demonstrated the value of balancing innovation with collaboration and proactively resolving conflict with constructive solutions.

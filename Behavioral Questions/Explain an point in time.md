### Give me an example of a time you had a conflict with a team member. How did you handle it?

#### My Response:
>One of the instance thaat i could think of where i had a conflict with a team member of mine, was during the development of the project that we had been developing for the smart india hackathon. a short description about the project it is an application that is designed to create annual reports for the institution. So we started with data collection etc using forms. We wanted to showcase analytical details about the data that we have got to make informed decision . so i insisted my teamate that we need to add one such feature. They told that we could statically add 3-4 graphs. I felt that an application should dynamic interaction and must allow users to create KPI of their needs. They said it would be difficult and it is a topic that is diverting from the problem statement. however i felt this was an game changer, so i concieved my teamates i would develop an module for that. using Ai (gemini) i was able to get input from the user as a text (normal but it should contain description about the table and i.e column in a high level) and on passing the prompt the graph would be added to the users dashboard

#### Structured Response:

>    **Situation:**  
	During the Smart India Hackathon, my team and I were developing an application to generate annual reports for an educational institution. One of our goals was to collect data using forms and present it effectively.
>	
	**Task:**  
	We needed to design the data presentation module. I proposed adding a dynamic analytics dashboard to allow users to generate custom KPIs and visualizations, while one of my teammates preferred using a few static charts, believing the dynamic feature was too complex and possibly outside the scope of the problem statement.
>	
	**Action:**  
	To resolve the disagreement, I acknowledged their concerns and proposed taking full responsibility for the feature as an independent module. I leveraged AI tools (specifically Gemini) to build a component that accepted natural language prompts to describe the table and graph requirements. The system then rendered corresponding charts on the user’s dashboard, enabling dynamic interaction without affecting the rest of the app's development.
>	
	**Result:**  
	The feature became a highlight during our final presentation and impressed the jury. It contributed significantly to our team winning the competition. The experience demonstrated the value of balancing innovation with collaboration and proactively resolving conflict with constructive solutions.




### **Question: Tell me about a time you had to switch technical approaches mid-project.**
>
	**Situation:**  
	I was working on a project to rank students based on multiple metrics—level, age, and a few academic factors—and display this data in a tabular format with filters and mark entry functionality.
>	
	**Task:**  
	I initially chose Firebase because I wanted to explore it in a real project. I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn, especially because of its real-time data sync capabilities.
>	
	**Action:**  
	However, as we got closer to the deadline, I realized that implementing complex filtering and multi-column ranking logic in Firebase's NoSQL structure was turning out to be inefficient and time-consuming. Since I had limited experience with Firebase and the project required reliable sorting and filtering across multiple fields, my teammate and I made a joint decision to switch to SQL, a stack we were already comfortable with. That allowed us to complete the project efficiently and meet the deadline.
>	
	**Result:**  
	The final product worked smoothly with proper filters and bulk mark entry. More importantly, the experience taught me that technology decisions should be based not just on learning goals, but also feasibility and deadlines. I applied this lesson in a later project, MedCo, where we first outlined the core user needs and then selected a tech stack optimized for mobile users. That helped us avoid missteps and stay efficient from the start.
	


### 3. Describe an occasion when you had to manage your time to complete a task. How did you do it?

#### My response

>Situation :
>In the month of January we had been part of a hackathon conducted by KYN - a startup , and it was on the eve of new year and I and my teamates were travelling to our hometown and we gave our best but not the fullest (It was the first round that happened during that time) . But to our surprise we were shortlist for the next round be hadn't built the website entire and we had only 1.5 days left. 

>Task:
>We first walked through the features that we gathered earlier to be implemented. And went through each one of the made priorities for each one of them.

>Action:
>We efficiently managed those implementation of those task , I took the lead and assigned tasks to my teamates that they are comfortable with to complete more tasks in the given span of time. I took care of the backend.

>Result:
>We were transformed the application to whole new level that they panel member who had gone through the Github screenshot of the older version said that "Both the versions are in two different poles." . The outcome was that with proper time and team management anything is possible

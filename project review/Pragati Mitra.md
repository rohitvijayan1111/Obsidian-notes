# Problem statement

>This project was developed as part of our participation in **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, where we were proud winners under the **Ministry of AYUSH** problem statement..

This was under ministry of ayush, which has a set of medical colleges, under it, they asked to develop website that could generate anualized report for their intiution every year.


### Context

The Ministry of AYUSH oversees a number of medical colleges across India. They challenged us to create a web-based solution that could **automatically generate comprehensive annual reports** for their institutions.

### Need for the Product

Educational institutions produce large volumes of data every academic year, including:
- Academic performance statistics
- Financial and audit statements
- Research publications
- Faculty and student achievements
    
Compiling all this into a single, coherent, and visually engaging annual report is a **time-consuming and error-prone** process. Institutions often struggle with:
- Aggregating and standardizing data from multiple departments
- Presenting the data in a structured and reader-friendly format
- Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements
### Current Pain Points

- Manual data entry and formatting consumes excessive time
- Difficulty integrating data from varied, disconnected sources
- Lack of automation leads to human errors and inconsistencies
- Poor data visualization limits the insights that can be drawn
- Reports often fail to meet professional or compliance standards

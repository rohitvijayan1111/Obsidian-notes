# Problem statement

>This project was developed as part of our participation in **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, where we were proud winners under the **Ministry of AYUSH** problem statement..

This was under ministry of ayush, which has a set of medical colleges, under it, they asked to develop website that could generate anualized report for their intiution every year.


### Context

The Ministry of AYUSH oversees a number of medical colleges across India. They challenged us to create a web-based solution that could **automatically generate comprehensive annual reports** for their institutions.

### Need for the Product

Educational institutions produce large volumes of data every academic year, including:
- Academic performance statistics
- Financial and audit statements
- Research publications
- Faculty and student achievements
    
Compiling all this into a single, coherent, and visually engaging annual report is a **time-consuming and error-prone** process. Institutions often struggle with:
- Aggregating and standardizing data from multiple departments
- Presenting the data in a structured and reader-friendly format
- Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements
### Current Pain Points

- Manual data entry and formatting consumes excessive time
- Difficulty integrating data from varied, disconnected sources
- Lack of automation leads to human errors and inconsistencies
- Poor data visualization limits the insights that can be drawn
- Reports often fail to meet professional or compliance standards

To empower HODs/Principal/IQAC with deeper insights, the platform offers two intuitive methods to create custom graphs based on **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

#### Method 1: **Natural Language Graph Generation**

- Users can simply **describe the graph they want** in plain English.
- An **AI-powered inbuilt graph generator** interprets the prompt and renders the requested visualization.
>Example:
>Create a multistack graph that helps us visualize the no of students who are eligible for placements and no of students who have already been placed.

![[Pasted image 20250709215028.png]]![[Pasted image 20250709215455.png]]
 The **multi-stacked bar graph** is then **automatically added to the user's dashboard** for quick reference and ongoing analysis.
 
ii)For users with technical expertiseâ€”such as **administrators or computer professionals**â€”the platform allows custom data visualization through **SQL queries**  via these dropdowns and input boxes .

#### Email 
Users can send emails directly to other students, faculty, or the HOD within the institution using the **built-in email system**â€”eliminating the need to switch to external platforms like Gmail.
![[Pasted image 20250709220036.png]]

#### Chatting feature 

Users can engage in real-time conversations with **other HODs, faculty, and students** through the built-in chat system. This facilitates **collaborative discussions** on common topics, departmental matters, and academic updatesâ€”all within the platform.

#### Forms

The forms created by all IQAC coordinators are automatically assigned to all HOD. they are responsible for managing the data of their department in these forms.

i) The can perform CRUD operations on the forms (Role based -> only their department level)
ii) assign individual forms to the faculty so that they would take responsibility of that particular form alone.
iii)They can also manage those assigned users i.e remove the user if not needed.

## DNS Server

- this could also help traffic equally

LOAD Balancing

- could split traffic based on cpu usage
- or dedicate some service to a instance and traffic all the request to it accordingly 




HOW WOULD TRAFFIC THE USER TO THE SAME INSTANCE VIA THE LOAD BALANCER:

ISSUE: the user might need to login again and again , as the session cookie might not be stored in the other instances. OR The user might have added the things to carts in one instance , some in the other, this becomes difficult 


SOLUTION:
- Storing it in the load balancer itself or somewhere else
- COULD ASSIGN RANDOM ID TO THE SERVER AND STORE IT IN THE COOKIE OF THE USER, THE LOADBALANCER WILL DIRECT THE TRAFFIC TO THE RIGHT USER , BASED ON THE ID

WHAT TO DO IF THE CACHE IS GETTING FULL
- TRY TO DISCARD THE ONE THAT IS OLD AND LESS RECENTLY USED



DATABASE REPLICATION:

- HAVE ONE MASTER AND CREATE REPLICA OF THE SLAVES
- so an write query hits the master, it is copied down to all others
- so thereby IT CAN BE USED AS A LOAD BALANCING FOR READ REQUEST

# PART 2

scalability can be thought in three levels:
- Application server
- Database
- Cache


> keep in mind, in scalability of application servers we must ensure that all the servers have the same codebase so that any user routed to any of the server, must have the capability to handle those requests.

>HOW TO ACHIEVE CACHING IN SUCH CASE:
>CACHING IN THE APPLICATION SERVER ITSELF:
>but we need to put forth a mechanism such that routing of a user is done to the same system.
>MAY %No of appliation server, but there is catch, what if many user some how land in the same server

> So to achieve this , we need to use an centralized cache

Scalability of application servers
---
### 🔑 **Scalability Golden Rule**

- **Consistency across servers**: Every server must serve **exactly the same codebase** and must not store any **user-related state** (e.g., sessions, profile pictures) locally.
    
- This ensures **Steve** (or any user) gets the **same result** regardless of the server he "lands on."
    

---

### 🗂️ **Session Management**

- **Problem**: Local session storage leads to inconsistent user experience.
    
- **Solution**: Use a **centralized session store** accessible by all servers.
    
    - Options:
        
        - ✅ **External Database** – reliable but potentially slower
            
        - ✅ **External Persistent Cache (e.g., Redis)** – faster, designed for quick session access
            
- **External** = outside the application server, but **in or near** the data center.
    

---

### 🚀 **Deployment Consistency**

- **Problem**: Some servers may run **outdated code** during deployments.
    
- **Solution**: Use tools like **Capistrano** to deploy the same code to **all servers at once**.
    
    - Capistrano is popular in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem but can be used elsewhere too.
        
    - Ensures **zero-downtime deployment** and uniformity.
        

---

### 🖥️ **Server Provisioning**

- After centralizing sessions and ensuring codebase uniformity:
    
    - Create an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** from a properly configured server.
        
    - Use this AMI as a **base image** to launch new instances.
        
    - After launching, just pull the **latest code** and you’re ready to go.
        

---

### ✅ **End Result**

- Horizontally scalable infrastructure with:
    
    - Identical, stateless app servers
        
    - Centralized session handling
        
    - Automated, consistent deployments
        
    - Reproducible infrastructure using AMIs

# Scalability of databases

Here's a clear and concise explanation of **Scalability for Dummies – Part 2: Database**, broken down into digestible sections:

---

## 🚨 The Problem: The Database Bottleneck

After solving server-side scalability (Part 1), your app can handle many concurrent users — **until the database becomes the bottleneck**.

- Most likely, you're using **MySQL** (or similar relational DB).
    
- As your user base and data volume grow, database queries slow down and **eventually crash your system**.
    

---

## 🛣️ Two Paths Forward

### 🛤️ **Path #1: Stick with MySQL (and make it scale)**

- This path involves keeping MySQL and scaling it with **more complexity** over time.
    

#### 🔧 Techniques:

1. **Master-slave replication**
    
    - **Writes** go to the **master**.
        
    - **Reads** go to one or more **slaves** to reduce load.
        
2. **Upgrade hardware**
    
    - Add more **RAM** and CPU to your master DB.
        
3. **Hire a DBA**
    
    - A Database Administrator will help with:
        
        - **Sharding** (splitting data across DBs)
            
        - **Denormalization**
            
        - **SQL performance tuning**
            

#### ⚠️ Drawbacks:

- Gets **expensive** (specialist staff, hardware upgrades)
    
- Gets **complex** (replication lag, schema design issues)
    
- Gets **slower** to evolve (every new optimization takes longer)
    

---

### 🌐 **Path #2: Embrace Denormalization and NoSQL**

- This path encourages you to **stop using JOINs** in your queries and restructure your data early.
    

#### 🔄 Steps:

1. **Denormalize your schema**
    
    - Duplicate some data to avoid JOINs
        
    - Optimize for **read performance**
        
2. **Do JOINs in application code**
    
    - Fetch related records manually in your backend logic
        
3. **Switch to NoSQL (optional but encouraged)**
    
    - Examples: **MongoDB**, **CouchDB**
        
    - Built to scale horizontally and avoid JOINs by design
        

#### ✅ Benefits:

- More scalable and performant
    
- Easier to shard and distribute
    
- Less DB overhead as load increases
    

#### ⚠️ Warning:

- **Eventually**, even NoSQL databases will slow down due to frequent reads.
    
- At that point, you'll need a **caching layer** (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to offload hot data.
    

---

## 🧠 Takeaways

|Feature|Path #1: Traditional RDBMS|Path #2: Denormalized / NoSQL|
|---|---|---|
|Schema Design|Normalized, many JOINs|Denormalized, no JOINs|
|Scaling Strategy|Vertical + Replication + Sharding|Horizontal + Caching|
|Who Handles JOINs|Database|Application code|
|Maintenance Cost|High (DBAs, tuning, upgrades)|Moderate (early rework, then smooth)|
|Long-term Performance|Diminishing returns|Scales well with proper caching|

---

## 💡 Final Tip

- The **earlier** you move toward denormalization and a scalable data structure, the **less effort** it will take later.
    
- Choose the **right path** based on your application's future needs, team expertise, and growth expectations.
    

---

Would you like diagrams, flashcards, or code examples (e.g., SQL JOIN vs NoSQL-style data retrieval)?

Sure! Here's a **detailed explanation of each technical topic** discussed in _Scalability for Dummies – Part 2: Database_, so you get a **clear understanding of both paths** — whether you're scaling traditional RDBMS like MySQL or adopting NoSQL and denormalization.

---

## 📌 1. **Master-Slave Replication**

### 🧠 What is it?

A replication setup where:

- **Master** server handles all **write** operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
    
- **Slave(s)** replicate the master's data and handle **read** operations (SELECT).
    
- The master  Writes the changes in a script file and the slaves continously looks for this changes and 
### ✅ Why it’s useful:

- Reduces **read load** on the master server.
    
- Increases **availability** and **fault tolerance**.
    

### ⚠️ Drawbacks:

- **Replication lag**: Slaves may lag slightly behind the master.
    
- Writes are still **centralized** — master becomes a bottleneck at high scale.
    

---

## 📌 2. **Denormalization**

### 🧠 What is it?

The process of **restructuring a relational database** to reduce the number of **JOINs** by **duplicating data** across tables or documents.

### 📝 Example:

Normalized:

```sql
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
```

Denormalized:

```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "customer_name": "Steve Rogers"
}
```

### ✅ Benefits:

- Faster **read queries** (no JOINs).
    
- Simplifies data access patterns.
    

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:

- More **storage used** (duplicated data).
    
- More complex **update logic** (need to update in multiple places).
    

---

## 📌 3. **SQL Tuning**

### 🧠 What is it?

Improving SQL query performance by optimizing:

- **Indexes**
    
- **Query structure**
    
- **Execution plans**
    

### ⚒️ Techniques:

- Add **indexes** on columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`.
    
- Avoid `SELECT *`, use only needed columns.
    
- Use **EXPLAIN** to analyze query execution.
    

### ⚠️ Challenge:

Tuning can get extremely complex for large schemas with heavy traffic and many JOINs.

---

## 📌 4. **Sharding**

### 🧠 What is it?

**Partitioning** your database horizontally by splitting your data across multiple databases or servers, called **shards**.

Each shard contains a **subset of the data**.

### 📝 Example:

- Shard 1 stores users with IDs 1–1000
    
- Shard 2 stores users with IDs 1001–2000
    

### ✅ Benefits:

- Increases performance and scalability.
    
- Helps avoid single-server bottlenecks.
    

### ⚠️ Drawbacks:

- Complex to implement and maintain.
    
- Requires application-level logic to route queries to the right shard.
    

---

## 📌 5. **Joins in Application Code**

### 🧠 What is it?

Instead of letting the database engine combine data across tables (`JOIN`), you:

- Query data from multiple sources
    
- Manually **combine them in your backend**
    

### 📝 Example (Node.js + MongoDB):

```js
const orders = await db.orders.find({ user_id: "123" });
const user = await db.users.findOne({ id: "123" });
return { ...user, orders };
```

### ✅ Benefits:

- Works well with NoSQL.
    
- Avoids costly JOIN operations.
    

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:

- More logic in your application code.
    
- Slightly more data fetching overhead.
    

---

## 📌 6. **NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)**

### 🧠 What is NoSQL?

Databases that **don’t rely on a strict relational schema** or JOINs. They support:

- Document stores (MongoDB)
    
- Key-value stores (Redis)
    
- Wide-column stores (Cassandra)
    

### ✅ Benefits:

- Highly **scalable** and **schema-less**.
    
- Easy to horizontally scale (sharding, replication).
    
- Fast for **read-heavy workloads**.
    

### ⚠️ Considerations:

- No JOINs — must denormalize.
    
- Consistency trade-offs (e.g., eventual consistency).
    
- Indexing and querying can still become a performance bottleneck.
    

that's the **NoSQL approach** using **denormalization** and **document embedding**. Instead of creating separate tables (or collections) for related data like `orders`, you embed them **within the parent document** — in this case, the `user` document.

---

## 📌 7. **Caching**

### 🧠 What is it?

A **fast-access layer** (typically in-memory) that stores frequently accessed data to reduce load on the main database.

### 🔧 Tools:

- **Redis**
    
- **Memcached**
    

### 📝 Example:

Instead of querying the database every time:

```js
// Try cache first
const cachedUser = redis.get(`user:123`);
if (cachedUser) return cachedUser;

// Fallback to DB
const user = await db.users.findOne({ id: 123 });
redis.set(`user:123`, user);
return user;
```

### ✅ Benefits:

- Greatly improves **response time**.
    
- Reduces load on primary database.
    

### ⚠️ Drawbacks:

- Cache **invalidation** is tricky.
    
- Data may be **stale** if not managed properly.

## Summary Table

|Topic|Description|Benefits|Drawbacks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Master-Slave Replication|Reads from slaves, writes to master|Load balancing, redundancy|Write bottleneck, replication lag|
|Denormalization|Duplicate data, avoid JOINs|Faster reads|Data inconsistency, more storage|
|SQL Tuning|Optimize queries and indexes|Better performance|Complex and time-consuming|
|Sharding|Split DB horizontally|Infinite horizontal scaling|Complex logic, operational overhead|

# Caching 

Absolutely! Let’s break this down thoroughly and **explain all the key ideas** from **Part 3: Caching**, from the _Scalability for Dummies_ series. This part focuses on **performance optimization** by using **in-memory caching** to reduce database load and speed up response time.

---

## 🧠 Why Caching Is Needed (Even After Database Scaling)

Even after you scale your database (like in Part 2), users may still experience **slow responses** when:

- The application makes **heavy or repeated reads**.
    
- Data fetching from disk is **too slow**.
    
- Complex logic needs to **assemble data from multiple tables or queries**.
    

So even with a scalable backend, **real-time performance suffers** without a cache.

---

## 💾 What Is a Cache?

A **cache** is a **temporary storage** for frequently accessed data that is stored in **RAM (memory)** — making access **lightning fast** compared to disk-based databases.

### ✅ In this article, the focus is on:

- **In-memory caches** like:
    
    - **Redis**
        
    - **Memcached**
        
- ❌ Not file-based caches (which are slow and painful for scaling/replication)
    

---

## 🔌 How Caching Works (The Concept)

### Basic Rule:

> Application should always **check the cache first** before hitting the database.

### Steps:

1. App wants data.
    
2. Check if it's in **cache** (`GET` by key).
    
3. If **present** → return it (super fast).
    
4. If **not present** → fetch from DB, **then store it in cache** for future use.
    

### Visual:

```
User Request → Cache (fast) → [If miss] → DB (slow) → Cache (store) → Return
```

---

## ⚡ Why Use In-Memory Caches?

|Reason|Benefit|
|---|---|
|RAM access|Extremely fast (1000x faster than disk)|
|Handles high traffic|Millions of reads/sec (e.g., Redis)|
|Reduces DB load|Frees DB for important writes/updates|
|Makes scaling easier|Stateless design|
|Supports async processing|Precompute and cache responses|

---

## 🛠️ Two Common Caching Patterns

### ### 📌 Pattern #1: **Cached Database Queries**

#### How it works:

- Cache the **raw result of a SQL query**.
    
- Use a **hash of the query string** as the cache key.
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category='books';
```

- Hash this query string → use that hash as cache key.
    

#### ✅ Pros:

- Easy to implement
    
- No need to change data models
    

#### ❌ Cons:

- **Hard to expire**: When data changes (e.g., one product is updated), you don’t know which queries to invalidate.
    
- **Stale data** risk
    
- Not great when your queries are **complex and dynamic**
    

---

### ### 📌 Pattern #2: **Cached Objects (Recommended)**

#### How it works:

- Think in **code objects**, not queries.
    
- When your app creates a `Product` object with all relevant data (images, prices, reviews, etc.), **cache the entire assembled object**.
    

```js
class Product {
  constructor(id) {
    this.data = this.fetchFromDB(id);
  }
}
```

After constructing the object:

```js
cache.set(`product:${id}`, JSON.stringify(product));
```

#### ✅ Pros:

- Easy to **invalidate** (e.g., `DELETE product:${id}`)
    
- Great for **object-oriented systems**
    
- Much faster retrieval — avoid multiple DB hits
    
- Enables **async processing** (workers can build and cache objects ahead of time)
    

#### 🚀 Real-world examples of object caching:

- Full blog articles (rendered)
    
- User sessions (never put these in DB!)
    
- Feed or timeline content
    
- User’s friend list
    

---

## 🚀 Asynchronous Processing with Caching

Once you decouple data access from the database, you can have **background workers** that:

- Build or update cached objects
    
- Push pre-rendered objects to cache
    
- Do heavy logic without blocking user requests
    

### Example:

1. A background job rebuilds the product cache every hour.
    
2. Frontend only reads the latest `product:123` from Redis.
    
3. **No DB hit needed unless object expires or is deleted.**
    

---

## 🧠 Why Redis Is Better Than Memcached (Sometimes)

|Feature|Redis|Memcached|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Types**|Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes|Only strings|
|**Persistence**|Yes (data can survive restarts)|No|
|**Pub/Sub**|Yes|No|
|**Complex logic**|Supports atomic operations|Not supported|
|**Scalability**|Horizontal sharding with Redis Cluster|Memcached scales well too|

> If you want **more than just key-value storage**, Redis is your best bet.

But:

> If you want **super-simple key-value caching only**, Memcached is lightweight and blazing fast.

---

## 🔑 Summary

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Cache First Principle**|Always check cache before DB|
|**Avoid file-based cache**|Use in-memory stores for scale|
|**Cached Queries**|Store SQL query results (less control over expiration)|
|**Cached Objects**|Store fully assembled code objects (easy to manage, invalidate, scale)|
|**Async Cache Builders**|Use background workers to precompute & cache objects|
|**Use Redis or Memcached**|Redis if you want advanced features; Memcached for simple fast caching|

---

## 🤔 Real-World Use Case Example

Let’s say you have a product page:

- It shows product details, seller info, user reviews, and related items.
    
- Instead of 5 different DB queries:
    
    1. Create a `ProductPageData` object
        
    2. Assemble everything in that object
        
    3. Cache it in Redis as `product_page:{productId}`
        
    4. On request, fetch directly from Redis → fast!
        

---

Would you like code samples in **Node.js**, **Python**, or any other language showing how to implement this caching strategy with Redis? Or perhaps a diagram of the full request flow?


You’re **absolutely right to ask this** — this touches the core of **cache consistency**, **cache invalidation**, and **synchronization strategy** between your **cache and database**. Let's clarify everything, both conceptually and practically.

---

## ✅ First: Your Understanding is Correct

> “If any update happens, do we synchronously update the cache and the DB?”

Yes — that's one valid and common strategy, but **not the only one**. Let’s break down **two common approaches** to handling this:

---

## 🧠 1. **Write-Through Caching (Synchronous Updates)**

### 🔄 What happens:

- **App writes to the cache AND to the database simultaneously.**
    
- Cache is always in sync with DB.
    

### ✔️ Good for:

- Read-heavy systems
    
- Strong consistency
    

### 📦 Example:

```js
function updateProduct(id, newData) {
  db.update("products", id, newData); // write to DB
  cache.set(`product:${id}`, newData); // write to cache
}
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Cache is always up to date.
    
- Simple to reason about.
    

### ❌ Cons:

- Slower write performance (two operations).
    
- More fragile if either DB or cache write fails.
    

---

## 🔁 2. **Write-Behind (or Write-Back) Caching**

### 🔄 What happens:

- **App writes to the cache only**, and cache writes to the DB in the background (via queue/worker).
    

### ✔️ Good for:

- Super-high write throughput (e.g., analytics, metrics)
    

### ❌ Risk:

- Data loss if cache crashes before DB update.
    
- Harder to guarantee consistency.
    

> **This pattern is powerful** but rarely used for **critical data** like users/products.

---

## ❌ Cached Queries Can't Be Modified Directly

You said:

> “Cached queries can’t be modified since the hash changes if value changes.”

And you’re **absolutely correct**.

### Here's why:

- When you cache a **query result**, the **cache key is a hash** of the **original query**.
    
- If **any piece of data changes**, you don’t know all the query hashes that were affected.
    
- Therefore, you **can't easily invalidate** or update them.
    

### 🎯 Real problem:

Say you update `product.name = "New Name"` in the DB:

- Which cached queries should be invalidated?
    
    - `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'Old Name'`
        
    - `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Books'`
        
    - Many others — and you don’t know which!
        

### 🚫 That’s why:

> Cached **queries** are hard to invalidate => not recommended at scale.

---

## ✅ Object Caching Solves This

Instead of:

- Caching the query result with an unknown query hash
    

You:

- Cache a known, structured **object** with a predictable key like `product:{id}`.
    

Then:

- When that product changes → just invalidate or update `product:{id}` key.
    

### 📦 Example:

```js
function updateProduct(id, newData) {
  db.update("products", id, newData);
  cache.del(`product:${id}`); // OR update it directly
}
```

You can even **fetch fresh data from the DB** and re-cache it after update:

```js
const updatedData = db.get("products", id);
cache.set(`product:${id}`, updatedData);
```

---

## 🔑 Summary

|Pattern|Cache Update?|DB Update?|Best For|
|---|---|---|---|
|Write-Through|✅ At write time|✅ At same time|Strong consistency|
|Write-Behind|✅ Immediately|🕒 Later (async)|High-throughput, less critical data|
|Cached Query|❌ Hard to invalidate|✅|Small apps or simple cases|
|Cached Object|✅ Easy to manage by ID/key|✅|Scalable, consistent systems|

---

## ✅ Best Practice (Recommended for You):

- Use **cached objects**, not query strings.
    
- Use **write-through strategy**:
    
    - Update both DB and cache in sync.
        
- Use **predictable cache keys** (e.g., `user:{id}`, `product:{id}`).
    
- Invalidate/update cache whenever data changes.
    

---

Would you like a code demo or Redis client example (Node.js, Python, etc.) showing write-through caching in practice?


# async

Absolutely! Let’s break down **Part 4: Asynchronism** from the _Scalability for Dummies_ series in **clear, structured, technical detail**, along with analogies, use cases, and modern implementation patterns.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea: Asynchronous Processing

Asynchronism means **not making users wait** while the system is doing time-consuming work. Instead, do it **in the background**, or **in advance**, so that the system **feels fast and responsive**.

---

## 🥖 The Bakery Analogy (Explained Technically)

Imagine a bakery as your **web backend**. You’re the **user** placing a request.

### 🔴 Problem:

If every customer walks in and asks for a **custom-baked** bread, and waits for it to finish — you get:

- **Long wait times**
    
- **Frustrated customers**
    
- **Poor scalability**
    

Instead, use **asynchronous approaches**:

---

## 🔧 Two Types of Asynchronous Processing (Explained)

---

### ✅ **Async #1 – Preprocessing / Pre-Rendering (Proactive Async)**

> “Bake the breads at night and sell them in the morning.”

### 🔁 Concept:

- Precompute or prebuild dynamic content **before users request it**.
    
- Serve it **instantly** when needed.
    

### 🧰 Used in:

- Static site generation (e.g., using **Next.js static pages**, **Hugo**, or **Jekyll**).
    
- Pre-rendering product pages, dashboards, analytics, etc.
    
- Caching results of heavy queries.
    

### ⚙️ How it's done:

1. A **cron job** runs every X minutes or hours.
    
2. It **generates static HTML** or JSON data from your dynamic sources.
    
3. These files are uploaded to **CDNs** like AWS S3 + CloudFront.
    
4. When a user visits the page — they receive a **pre-rendered version** (no DB, no backend load).
    

### 📈 Benefits:

|Feature|Result|
|---|---|
|Pre-rendering|Zero backend processing on request|
|CDN delivery|Lightning-fast global response|
|Easy to scale|CDN handles the load, not your app|
|Cheap|No need for server compute per request|

### 🔥 Example:

- A blog with 10,000 articles.
    
- Each article is written in markdown and rendered using React or a CMS.
    
- Instead of generating the article on each visit, you generate HTML **once every hour** and cache it.
    

---

### ✅ **Async #2 – Job Queueing (Reactive Async)**

> “Customer requests a custom cake; bakery queues it and notifies when done.”

### 🔁 Concept:

- Let the **user trigger a task**, but **don’t block** them waiting for the result.
    
- Instead, **push the task to a queue**, do it **in background**, and **notify** when done.
    

---

### ⚙️ How it works technically:

#### 🧾 Step-by-step:

1. **User submits** a request (e.g., to export a PDF report).
    
2. The backend:
    
    - **Adds the task to a queue** (e.g., Redis list, RabbitMQ topic).
        
    - **Immediately responds** with: “Job submitted.”
        
3. **Worker(s)** running in the background:
    
    - Listen to the queue
        
    - Pick up jobs
        
    - Process them
        
    - Mark them as done and update the result in the database or cache.
        
4. Frontend **polls or gets notified** (via WebSocket, long polling, or server-sent events).
    
5. Once the job is done, user gets the result.

## 💡 Why Asynchronism Helps Scalability

|Traditional (Synchronous)|Asynchronous|
|---|---|
|User waits for task to finish|Task is queued, user gets notified later|
|Ties up web server resources|Workers handle jobs independently|
|Doesn’t scale well|Can run 10s, 100s of workers in parallel|
|Poor UX on long-running tasks|Snappy UI, faster perceived performance|

---

## 🧠 Design Considerations

### 🔑 Use Async When:

- Tasks take **more than a second**
    
- Tasks are **not critical to immediate UI**
    
- Tasks can be **processed in background**
    

### ❌ Don’t Use Async When:

- The user needs the **result immediately** (e.g., login)
    
- You need **strong consistency and atomicity**

## 🎯 Bonus: Combining Both Async Types

You can often **combine Async #1 and #2** for best performance:

|Pattern|Example|
|---|---|
|Async #1: Precompute reports|Run nightly jobs to cache key data|
|Async #2: On-demand export|Let user request PDF download; process it via queue|

---

## ✅ Summary

|Async Pattern|Description|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Pre-processing**|Do the work in advance, serve static/cached content|Static sites, dashboards, blogs|
|**Queue-based**|Do the work in background via job queues|Heavy processing, exports, ML, etc|

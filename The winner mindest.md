1) Trust me it will never stop -> if will stop if i achieve X = Infinite game
2) ike Let It Be who cares versus when you think that this is

4:51

what my life is going to be probably I'm going to be doing till the deathbed you think in a very different

4:58

way so if you think that I am going to delay living my life

5:03

to the fullest

5:10

and these are just excuses that you're giving to

5:15

yourself write down today what are the things that you truly

5:20

want to do and you like to do and start doing only that everything else just

5:28

eliminate it immediate mediately because if you're going to

5:34

keep postponing you're just giving an excuse most of the

5:40

times we feel that we give excuses of family we give excuses of time we give

5:46

excuses of money but if you truly want to do something significant really


Excuse of family,money, time -> NEVER WAIT FOR EVERYTHING TO START it 0< IF U WANT TO DO <DO IT


People who play finite & limited games are always losers in the long run




RULE 2: Don't feel hurt ->Make this irreplacable and untopable

## Don’t get hurt

8:56

me was the hardest to overcome which I believe makes anyone and

9:04

everyone who applies this in their life makes them irreplaceable in the world and makes them truly

9:11

Unstoppable the rule is don't get hurt and what I mean by that in every

9:18

situation wherever we want to feel amazing and we want to feel nice and we don't feel that we get hurt we're like

9:25

oh opportunity we like

9:43

and that's what actually makes you weak and the weaker you are the more you get

9:48

hurt the more you'll suppress your emotions the more you suppress your emotions you won't let your original ideas come out and if you don't let your

9:54

original ideas come out you won't have a stand and if you don't have a stand you'll be replaceable in an organization




What is that one thing which hurts me the most in my life?



## Think that your parents are dead

11:01

is a very strong rule listen to it

11:06

carefully and do this exercise with me because it's a lot of exercises right everyone watching this everyone

11:13

listening to me right now do this don't get hurt by the sentence I'm going to say live as if your mother and father

11:20

were dead here's what I mean by that every human

11:26

being should love their parents yet be free from the expectations and

11:34

the criticism which parents give them and knowingly or unknowingly you

11:40

try to live up to them and that's why you're not free that's why you can't operate from

11:46



the free mindset let me make it more deeper for you so that you get the better

11:52

perspective what are the top three expectations which your parents have

11:57

from you write that down maybe they want you to live with them till the retirement maybe they want you

12:05

to build lot of financial capital for them and the family maybe they want you to

12:13

marry someone who they want you to marry now there's a next question what are the

12:19

top three criticisms that since childhood your parents knowingly or

12:26

unknowingly have been reminding you

12:44

May what are these criticisms here's one question I wanted

12:49

to answer to finish this off if you were truly Fearless if you were truly Limitless there was nothing stopping you

12:57

there were nobody judging you what would be that one thing that you haven't done till now and you would do

13:04

it can be as simple as I would color my hair this way I would walk up in front

13:09

of my parents this way I will leave my career and d



If you are truly fearless, limitless and nothing stopping you noboding stop ypu what would u do?




### Rule 4: what is your edge



## What’s your slight edge?

13:40

Edge what's your slight Edge and whatever it is don't fake it in the

13:47

world be real to it now what do I mean by that like are you earning at the maximum potential that you have as a

13:53

human being are you earning that today yes or no are you ear

14:01

earning what top 1% of the people earn in your field let's say if your field is

14:08

content strategist do you earn top 1% of a Content strategist now write that down what do

14:16

you think is stopping you to reach that top 1% or reach that maximum potential

14:23

which you have as a human being which is why you're not able to earn that much okay here's what I want

14:29

to do okay there are several ways to look at this let's pick up video editing

14:36

because maximum people are there are you in the top 1% of video editors in your company if that's the answer then first

14:43

pick is done then we go upper are you earning top 1% of what top 1% editors earn in the

14:51

podcasting field you know yes or no if you're earning that then are you the one

14:57

who is top 1% in the we field of social media let's say if that is sorted then

15:02

you do are you in the top 1% in the country for video editing for every

15:08

field and if that is also sorted then you do are you the top 1% in the

15:15

world so whichever Circle you are in 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay you only think about

15:22

the next Circle wherever you are today what's your next Circle and for that what is stopping you write that down

15:29

right three things that you think is your limitation which is stopping you to really reach your Edge now whatever your

15:36

three limitations are that's your

15:44

Edge now the good thing is that you

15:51

know and the most important person and the most valuable person is the one who

15:57

knows what are my limitations and what is my capacity and what do I need to achieve

16:04

to go from where I am at what's my Edge and how do I push that edge to get out

16:10

of the circle because here's what happens most of the people don't know

16:15

what their capacity is but out of them most of the people

16:21

who know what their capacity is they either pretend to know more and live in a delusion

16:30

they try to pretend and other people cash this and many people they don't even know what they're capable of

16:36

so they live under the radar and they're like who cares if you don't know your

16:43

Edge start writing down it can be work it can be

16:50

relationships it can be anything why are you valued are you valued because you do

16:56

your task well no you are valued because you do something

17:02

which other people can't or you're just a piece of

17:07

convenient you'll be replaced by somebody else it's just people see

17:17

that are you that person you that person who can't be

17:23

changed these are the questions you need to answer yourself and if you are on the spec

17:32

that trust me if you become an entrepreneur or do a job or do

17:37

freelancing or run an agency no matter what you do you'll be replaced you'll be always unhappy you'll always live with

17:45

this insecurity even if you run your own business because somebody else will come

17:51

and take your clients off if you in a job you'll be replaced quickly because somebody will come

17:56

either cut on price or do s



What is stopping you to reach that top 1%?


![[Pasted image 20250511185456.png]]


Write 3 things that are your limitations, which are
stopping you to really reach your edge



The most important person knows their limitations and my capacity


why are you valued -> you do something other people can't 

This is working for now, so just go with it.
Are you that person?

Are you that person who can't be changed?



RULE 5: What do you from morning to night? I


![[Pasted image 20250511185801.png]]

mark the things that are getting u closer to 1% goal


You don't have blinders on-> people 

![[Pasted image 20250511185858.png]]




rule 6: Stop pleasing people -> whoever 

u are betraying yourself,


rule 7:
Your purpose should come
before your world relationsl


how many times have u sacrified ur 

## Your purpose should come before world relationships

23:10

your world relationship here's what I mean by it how many times you have sacrificed on your work

23:18

or the purpose or the thing that gives you Joy the most

23:24

because you say hey I wanted to spend more time with my family I because I

23:31

want to spend more time with my people with my wife with my husband with my

23:36

girlfriend with my boyfriend here's what happens you sacrifice on that you give

23:44

an excuse to spend time with them when you are with them then you're thinking constantly about work so you're not

23:49

present there you're not present here in both the places you just are giving nothing if at any point you feel that

23:57

make time spend personal life you actually tone down the ambition

24:06

that comes out of your mouth which is completely okay most of

24:11

the people here's what they do they have big Ambitions they talk about changing the world and building the big

24:18

purpose and then they give an excuse for the lack of discipline that they have

24:24

and they put that excuse like hey I didn't do it because of my family I

24:30

didn't do it because of my girlfriend duties or boyfriend duties I didn't do it because of my exyz duty you're doing

24:38

Injustice to yourself you're doing Injustice to your potential you're doing Injustice to your purpose and you're

24:43

doing Injustice to your relationships because they are not bearing the fruits

24:48

of your maximum potential if you would have actually truly lived your purpose do you think

24:55

your parents would have a better life yeah yes do you think your partner will have a better life yes do you think

25:02

personally mentally emotionally financially you will feel more secure and nice

25:09

yes but you don't do it because your lack of discipline gives you some sort

25:16

of excuse and that excuse most of the time is given on a relationship

25:37

stop giving these excuses that I sacrific this because of my relationship have you ever done that in your own head

25:44

I don't go out with my friends because I go out with my friends and be

25:55

like have you ever done



rule 8:


Become friends with people
who callout your mediocrity


26:15

don't want to follow any rule number eight is for everybody become friends

## Become friends with people who call out on your mediocrity

26:21

with people who call out on your mediocrity so if you don't have those friends find a colleague

26:29

if you don't have that find a family member or a cousin if you don't trust them find out

26:35

a stranger in next one week give yourself a task and find somebody and here's what you're going to do you're

26:40

going to sit with them once a week for 10 minutes 20 minutes 30

26:45

minutes and tell them this is what my goals are and this is why I'm not able to achieve it and talk about all the

26:52

excuses and the problems that you have because of why you're not able to achieve it and let them call it out

26:59

and you do the same with them so let's say if two people are here

27:04

you become friends and every week you

27:11

tell let what do you think why I was not able to do it and let that person call

27:17

it out and every time you sound mediocre you sound average you sound that it's

27:24

just your own madeup excuse let your friends call it out

27:29

and you need to enjoy that process you don't need to get hurt by it a lot of people when they have friends they give

27:34

them feedback they get hurt yes right like you you maybe not say

27:41

this but in your head you think like bro

27:47

like enjoy when somebody calls you out for your mediocrity so from today build

27:54

have that one person give yourself this task it can be either in the organization it

28:00

can be outside in the world it can be your boyfriend girlfriend families

28:05

whoever I would I would really appreciate or maybe

28:11

encourage that you have somebody in your life who's apart from your husband wife

28:17

girlfriend boyfriend if you have a friend that it's much better if it you have a colleague

28:22

then it's much better because usually the couples who are not very mature your

28:28

who have not gone through their own learnings when you start telling them this is your limitation they'll start

28:34

calling out that limitation in middle of a fight and it won't be a pretty scene if you're a mature couple you think that

28:40

You' have reached that point in your life go do it but if you're someone who's just in relationship 1 2 3 years

28:47

in please don't find out a friend or a colleague who is different than just your partner okay so have a friend or

28:56

maybe set of friends who call you out on your medum this number nine are you too caught up

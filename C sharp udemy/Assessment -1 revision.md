- **COM** stands for **Component Object Model.** existed before .NET
- There are two major disadvantages of the COM Framework. They are as follows:

1. Incomplete Object-Oriented Programming means it will not support all the features of OOPs.
2. Platform Dependent means COM applications can run on only Windows OS.

To overcome the above problems, Microsoft introduces **.NET Framework**.


##### **What does .NET Represent?**

**NET** stands for **Network Enabled Technology** (Internet). In .NET, dot (.) refers to **Object-Oriented,** and NET refers to the internet. So, the complete .NET means through Object-Oriented we can implement internet-based applications.
- Supports cross platform and supports multiple languages.


##### **What is a Framework?**

A framework is a software. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.

**What does the .NET Framework Provide?**

The DOT NET Framework provides two things as follows

1. **BCL** (Base Class Libraries)
2. **CLR** (Common Language Runtime)

##### **What is BCL?**

Base Class Libraries (BCL) are designed by Microsoft. Without BCL we can’t write any code in .NET. So, BCL is also known as the basic building block of .NET Programs.

1. **BCL:** The **Base** **Class Library** provides a set of APIs and types for common functionality. It provides types for strings, dates, numbers, etc. The Class Library includes APIs for reading and writing files, connecting to databases, drawing, and more.
##### **What is CLR?**

CLR stands for Common Language Runtime and it is the core component under the .NET framework which is responsible for converting the MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code. In our CLR session, we will discuss **CLR** in detail.

- Two phase of compilation (By Compiler - converts C# code into MSIL or IL), By CLR (using JIT) to convert MSIL into machine code /native code (native code means code specific to the Operating system)
  
1. **CLR**: The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the execution engine that handles running applications. It provides services like thread management, garbage collection, type safety, exception handling, and more.
- The compiled source code is stored in the assembly as .dll file . The CLR uses this files during runtime to run the application.

##### **What is Exactly .NET?**

.NET is a framework tool that supports many programming languages and many technologies.
- Had three types of .NET:
	- NET Framework - old one, majorly supported windows OS
	- .NET or .NET - cross platform
	- Xamarian - supports mobile application both android and ios

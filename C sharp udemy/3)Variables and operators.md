- u cant use a variable before init ? what error comes **(Use of unassigned local variable 'x')**->**compile-time error** in **C#**
- use can use keywords as variable name using "@" sign
- Compile-time error: _Cannot implicitly convert type_->assigning a value of the wrong type to a variable 
- Strongly typed-> means datatype of a variable cannot be changed

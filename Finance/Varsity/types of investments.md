### Commodity 

### Real estate


- the company assumes that each share is worth Rs.10, and because there is Rs.5 crore as share capital, there have to be 50 lakh shares, with each share worth Rs.10. In this context, Rs.10 is called the ‘Face value’ (FV) of the share.

# IPO
1. As an investor in the IPO, you should read through the DRHP to know everything about the company.


**_Absolute Return_** – This is the return that your trade or investment generates in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?

The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100

i.e. [3550/3030 -1] *100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

_**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** –_ An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030, held the stock for two years, and sold it at 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?

CAGR factors in the time component, which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.

The formula to calculate CAGR is…

![CAGR](http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR.jpg)

Applying this to answer the question…

{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%

This means the investment grew at a rate of 8.2% for two years. As of today, the bank fixed deposit market offers 5.5% with capital protection hence, 8.2% return looks ok compared to a fixed deposit.

So, always use CAGR to check returns over multiple years. Use absolute return when your time frame is for a year or lesser.

What if you bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within six months? In that case, you have generated 17.16% in 6 months, which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.

So the point is if you have to compare returns, it’s best done when the return is expressed on an annualized basis.


##  The Index

Luckily you need not track these selected companies individually to get a sense of how the markets are doing. The important companies are pre-packaged and continuously monitored to give you this information. This pre-packaged market sentiment indicator is called the ‘Stock market Index.’

There are a few impo

- NiFTY 50
- **S&P BSE Sensex**




## 7.5 – Sector-specific indices

While the Sensex and Nifty represent the broader markets, certain indices represent specific sectors.


**_[![glossary](http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png)](http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png)_**Upper and Lower Circuit – The exchange sets up a price band within which the stock can be traded on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit, and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% based on the exchange’s selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company. The criteria (in terms of exchange restriction) changes for derivatives stocks (and index); more on that later.


### Key takeaways from this chapter

Debt + arbitage ->SEC 50AA, most tax efficent 
![[Pasted image 20251104091138.png]]
f you have 30% in a debt fund in the

30:10

form of an arbitrage, then 2 years long

30:15

that becomes more tax efficient. Can you repeat that? 30% of 30% 35% of a debt fund if it's arbitrage

30:24

fund. Arbitrage is buying and selling a same commodity. M

30:30

and taking care of price differences called arbitrage. I'll give you an example. Yeah. If you buy apples in dada

30:37

in the morning on the phone call you speak to somebody in Malad saying that yeah I'll give you one apple one kg

30:43

apple at 102 rupees within 3 hours but I bought it in dada at 100 rupees.

30:50

I already have bought the apples. I already have a contract to sell the apple at 102. I have taken 3 hours

30:57

mutath because it'll take three hours of travel time. This is called arbitrage.

31:03

So buying a share in cash market and immediately contracting to sell it

31:08

tomorrow and taking care of the price difference is called arbitrage. M

31:13

so any debt fund which has 65% in pure bonds like we discussed and 35% in

31:20

equity arbitrage will qualify for a long-term capital

31:25

gain after 2 years. So then that'll be taxed at 12 and a half% for absolutely sir. Got it. So that's the most efficient tax uh

31:34

taxable tax efficient instrument especially if you get into the highest tax bracket for the short-term goal requirements.

31:40

Absolutely. any money greater than 10 years, it'll be a painful process of

HOW TO CHOOSE MF :


![[Pasted image 20251104092337.png]]


ou'll be

42:05

shocked on one thing which is a finding higher the last point return lower the chance

## The mindset shift that separates rich from comfortable

42:13

that he will deliver that return next year. Oh, so basically the fund which has the highest rank last year less there is a

42:20

probability that it'll give the the similar returns next year. Next year. So that has been the study. Uh there is a minus.68

42:27

negative correlation and people buy all funds when it's time to sell

42:33

and they sell all funds when it is time to buy. I think a classic example of that has been the quant mutual funds


---
There's a best asset class. Be married to an asset class. Don't be married to a scheme. Got it. Best asset class. I think what

43:12

you've been trying saying from the last 1 hour is that equity. Within equity, which mutual fund will be

43:18

the best? That depends on the time horizon and the time in which you're investing in that mutual fund. So, how

43:23

long do you typically need to give a mutual fund after you've invested to sort of judge whether it was a good call

43:28

or a bad call? If you're doing it self and uh you're

43:34

managing your own money then four to five years four to five years and what will I look at by analyzing it just the CGR in

43:41

compared to other other category average no I would see whether he has beaten the benchmark

43:46

okay benchmark of that so or it could be the category average of that scheme uh because categories are quite uh

43:53

everybody is operating in a different it's just the benchmark of that scheme so if it's a midcap mutual fund compare

43:58

it to the midcap index Tier one benchmark. See what Sebi did in 2018 was told everybody please follow one

44:04

benchmarker. That's tier one benchmark is common for everyone. Tier one benchmark. Tier one benchmark. There's something

44:10

called tier 2 benchmark. Okay. So if you're buying a mutual fund, if you're buying a midcap fund in India,

44:16

the benchmark is Nifty Midcap 150. Okay. There are at least seven different

44:21

midcap indices NSE and BSE publish. Okay. If this was not enough, FTSC and MSEI

44:28

also published their midcap index. But if you're a mutual fund investor, your life has to be revolving around Nifty


---
dcap 150. So this is for just the midcap mutual fund, right? But let's say I'm investing

44:39

in a multicap fund or let's say the parakari flexi cap fund considered to be one of the best mutual funds. What am I

44:46

comparing that with to say that benchmark for flexiap is n 500 nse 500.

44:52

What sebi did now in 2018? They said take nse 500 divide this into three

44:57

m 100 stocks is large cap subsequent 150 is midcap the last 250 is small cap

45:04

they've created three babies out of nse 500 and said this is the benchmarking of

45:09

tier 1 for most of the funds in India got it got it uh but yeah uh anybody who understands

45:15

the formation of this uh if I'm doing benchmarking n 500 NC's website today

45:22

running or at least 5 days back said NEC 500 is the top 500 companies in Indian listed

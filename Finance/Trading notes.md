### **Chapter 5.2 – The Marubozu**

- **Definition**: "Marubozu" means “Bald” in Japanese; it’s a single candlestick pattern with no upper or lower shadow (i.e., no wicks).
    
- **Types**:
    
    1. **Bullish Marubozu** – Indicates strong buying pressure.
        
    2. **Bearish Marubozu** – Indicates strong selling pressure.
        
- **Key Point**: Marubozu **violates Rule 3** of candlestick trading (i.e., _"look for prior trend"_). It can appear anywhere on the chart and still be valid.

### **Three Important Candlestick Rules (Recap)**:

1. **Buy strength, sell weakness**
    
2. **Be flexible, verify and quantify patterns**
    
3. **Look for prior trend** _(violated by Marubozu)_

### **Chapter 5.3 – Bullish Marubozu**

- **OHLC Criteria**:
    
    - **Open = Low**
        
    - **High = Close**
        
- **Indicates**: Intense buying throughout the session. Sentiment has turned bullish.
    
- **Trading Strategy**:
    
    - **Buy** around the **closing price**.
        
    - **Stoploss** at the **low** of the marubozu.
        

#### **Risk Profiles**:

- **Risk Taker**:
    
    - Buys **on the same day**, near 3:20 PM after validating:
        
        - Open ≈ Low
            
        - CMP ≈ High
            
- **Risk Averse**:
    
    - Buys **next day** only if it's a **blue (bullish) candle**.
        
    - Confirmation before entering.
        
    - Disadvantage: higher entry, deeper stoploss.
        

#### **Real Example**:

- Stock: **ACC Limited**
    
- OHLC: O = 971.8, H = 1030.2, L = 970.1, C = 1028.4
    
- Trade Setup:
    
    - **Buy** @ 1028.4
        
    - **Stoploss** @ 970.0

### **Chapter 5.4 – Stoploss in Bullish Marubozu**

- **Built-in Risk Management**: Stoploss = **Low** of the Marubozu.
    
- **If stoploss is hit**:
    
    - Exit the trade.
        
    - Accept the loss.
        
    - Do **not deviate** from trading rules.

    - Shorts on the same day after confirming:
        
        - Open ≈ High
            
        - CMP ≈ Low
            
- **Risk Averse**:
    
    - Shorts the **next day** only if it’s a **red (bearish) candle**.
        
    - Ensures strength in bearishness.
        

#### **Real Example**:

### **Chapter 5.4 – Trade Trap: Avoid Extreme Candles**

- **Avoid** candles with:
    
    - **Range < 1%** (Too small → No clear trend).
        
    - **Range > 10%** (Too big → Stoploss too deep).
        
- **Reason**:
    
    - Small candles = low activity → weak signal.
        
    - Long candles = high volatility → risky stoploss.

|**Bearish Marubozu**|Sell near close (CMP ≈ Low, Open ≈ High)|High of the candle|

## 🎯 **Best Practice: Use Daily Charts (1D)**

For **most traders**, especially beginners and swing traders:

- **Use the Daily (1D) chart**.
    
- Marubozu is most **reliable** on this timeframe.
    
- It gives clear signals without too much market noise.
    

---

## 🕰️ **How to Use on Other Timeframes**

### ✅ **Intraday (15m / 1h)**

- Use for **scalping or quick day trades**.
    
- Confirm with volume and price action.
    
- Set **tight stoploss** and **quick targets**.
    
- More risky; patterns can fail more often.
    

### ✅ **Daily (1D)**

- **Best for swing trading** (holding for few days).
    
- Clear structure, good reliability.
    
- Set wider stoploss than intraday, but better follow-through.
    

### ✅ **Weekly (1W) or Monthly (1M)**

- Use for **big-picture positional trades**.
    
- Pattern must be strong and supported by volume or fundamentals.
    
- Fewer signals but more powerful.
    

---

## 🔍 Example Use Case: Swing Trade with Daily Chart

Let's say you're trading with **1D candles**:

- You buy near Tuesday’s close.
    
- You hold for a few days.

# Doji and Spinning top

Of course! Let me walk you through this topic in **very detailed**, step-by-step fashion so you not only understand **spinning tops** and **dojis**, but also **how to trade** using the insights they offer.

# 📘 Chapter 6: Spinning Tops & Dojis — Indecision Candles

---

## 🌀 6.1 – **Spinning Tops**

### 🔍 **What is a Spinning Top?**

A **spinning top** is a type of candlestick with:

- A **small real body** (open and close are close together)
    
- A **long upper shadow**
    
- A **long lower shadow**
    
- Shadows (wicks) are **almost equal**
    

**Color doesn't matter** — it could be red or blue.

---

### 🔄 **What Does It Represent?**

It shows **indecision in the market**.

#### 💡 Think of the candle as a story:

1. **Small Body** → Bulls and bears fought all day but closed the day with almost no gain or loss.
    
2. **Upper Wick** → Bulls tried to take the price up but failed.
    
3. **Lower Wick** → Bears tried to push it down but also failed.
    

> **Conclusion**: No side (bulls or bears) could win. Market is confused. It's a **"pause" candle**, not a signal by itself.

---

## 📉 6.2 – **Spinning Tops in a Downtrend**

When a spinning top appears **after a continuous fall**, here’s what it could mean:

### 🧠 Interpretations:

1. **Bears might be tired** – They pushed the price down but now are losing steam.
    
2. **Bulls are trying to fight back** – They’re entering but haven’t won yet.
    

### 🤔 What can happen next?

There are **two equal possibilities**:

- 📉 The **downtrend continues** if bears regain control.
    
- 📈 A **trend reversal** starts if bulls succeed.
    

---

### 🛠️ **Trading Strategy in a Downtrend**

Because it’s unclear, play **defensively**:

- If you want to **go long (buy)**:
    
    - Buy only **half the quantity** (e.g., 250 shares if your full quantity is 500).
        
    - Wait for confirmation (if price rises the next day).
        
    - If it rises → **buy more** (average up).
        
    - If it falls → **exit** early with **limited loss** on a smaller position.
        

🧠 _This approach reduces your risk while keeping you ready to benefit if the reversal actually happens._

---

## 📈 6.2 – **Spinning Tops in an Uptrend**

Now imagine the **market has been going up** for several days, and then a spinning top appears.

### 🧠 Interpretations:

1. **Bulls might be tired** – They’ve run out of strength.
    
2. **Bears are testing** – They’re trying to push down.
    

Again, this shows **uncertainty**.

---

### 🛠️ **Trading Strategy in an Uptrend**

If you’re **already holding** the stock:

- **Book profit on 50%** of your position.
    
- Keep the other 50% invested.
    

#### What can happen next?

- 📉 If price drops → you’ve locked in gains on half, and you can sell the rest.
    
- 📈 If price rises → you’re still in the game with 50% and can enjoy more gains.
    

🧠 _This method lets you protect profits while not missing future upside._

---

## 🧘 6.3 – **The Doji Candle**

### 🔍 What is a Doji?

A **doji** is a candle with:

- **Open = Close** (or nearly the same)
    
- **Very small or no real body**
    
- Can have **long or short shadows**
    

> It looks like a “+” or a “cross”.

---

### 🔁 Doji vs. Spinning Top:

|Feature|Spinning Top|Doji|
|---|---|---|
|Real Body|Small but visible|Very tiny or none|
|Meaning|Indecision|Indecision|
|Appearance|Top with wicks above & below|Looks like a cross or plus|

🧠 _In practice, they are both treated similarly._

---

## 🔀 **What Do These Candles Mean for You?**

Whenever you see a **spinning top** or **doji** — especially after a clear trend — it means:

- The current trend may be **weakening**
    
- A **reversal or continuation** is equally possible
    
- **Big movement is coming**, but direction is uncertain
    

Think of them as:

> 🔕 **"Pause" candles** that warn of a potential storm ahead — not trade signals by themselves.

---

## 📊 Example: How to Act Based on These Candles

### 🎯 Case 1 – Downtrend + Spinning Top

You see a stock falling for 5 days. On Day 6, a spinning top appears.

→ You think, “Maybe the fall is ending.”

**What you do:**

- Buy **half quantity**
    
- Set a **tight stoploss** below the spinning top’s low
    
- Wait for Day 7:
    
    - If green candle = buy more (add)
        
    - If red candle = exit (cut losses early)
        

---

### 🎯 Case 2 – Uptrend + Doji

You bought a stock at ₹200. It rallied to ₹250 over a week. Suddenly, you see a **doji** on the chart.

→ You think, “Market is pausing. Something’s up.”

**What you do:**

- Sell **half** your holding
    
- Wait:
    
    - If market falls → Sell rest, book full profit
        
    - If market rises → Enjoy profits on remaining shares
        

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Spinning tops** have small bodies, equal upper & lower shadows. They show **indecision**.
    
2. **Color doesn't matter** – it’s the structure that’s important.
    
3. They appear at **tops and bottoms** of trends.
    
4. They don’t give clear buy/sell signals — but **warn you** of change.
    
5. In uncertain situations:
    
    - **Reduce risk** by taking half trades or booking partial profits.
        
    - **Wait for confirmation** (next day’s candle direction).
        
6. **Dojis** are like spinning tops with **no body at all**. Treated similarly.
    

---

## 🎓 Final Tip:

Always **combine** spinning tops and dojis with:

- Volume analysis
    
- Trendlines
    
- Support/resistance zones
    
- Next day's candle for confirmation
    

That way, you avoid **false signals** and **trade with confidence**.

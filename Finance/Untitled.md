# Basics

Great question! Understanding **Equity, Debt, Commodity**, and **Futures & Options (F&O)** is fundamental to navigating financial markets. Here's a **detailed and clear explanation** of each:

---

## 🔵 1. **Equity**

**Equity** represents **ownership** in a company.

### 📌 Key Features:

- When you **buy equity shares** (or just "shares"), you own a **part of that company**.
    
- Shareholders have **voting rights** and may receive **dividends**.
    
- Share price fluctuates based on **company performance**, **market demand**, and **economic conditions**.
    

### ✅ Example:

If you buy 100 shares of Reliance at ₹2,500/share:

- You’re a **minor owner** of Reliance.
    
- If Reliance performs well, share price may go up, and you could earn profits.
    
- If it pays dividends, you receive a portion of profits.
    

---

## 🟡 2. **Debt**

**Debt instruments** are like **loans** you give to a company or government in exchange for **interest**.

### 📌 Key Features:

- You are **not an owner**, just a **lender**.
    
- These are considered **lower risk** compared to equities.
    
- They give **fixed returns** over time (like interest).
    

### Common Debt Instruments:

- **Bonds**
    
- **Debentures**
    
- **Treasury Bills**
    

### ✅ Example:

You invest ₹10,000 in a 5-year bond offering 7% annual interest:

- You receive ₹700/year as interest.
    
- After 5 years, you get ₹10,000 back.
    

---

## 🟤 3. **Commodities**

**Commodities** are **raw materials or primary goods** that can be bought and sold.

### 📌 Common Types:

- **Metals** – Gold, Silver, Copper
    
- **Energy** – Crude oil, Natural gas
    
- **Agricultural** – Wheat, Sugar, Coffee
    

### 📊 Traded On:

- **MCX** (Multi Commodity Exchange – India)
    
- **NYMEX**, **COMEX** (global)
    

### ✅ Example:

You speculate that **gold prices will rise**, so you buy a gold contract today and plan to sell it at a higher price later.

---

## 🔴 4. **Futures & Options (F&O)**

These are **derivative instruments**, meaning their value is based on an underlying asset (like a stock, index, or commodity).

---

### 📍 **Futures**

A **future** is a contract to **buy or sell** an asset at a **predetermined price** on a **specific future date**.

#### ✅ Example:

You enter a Nifty Future contract to buy Nifty at 22,000 in 1 month. If Nifty rises to 22,500, you profit ₹500 per unit.

### 📍 Key Features:

- **Obligation to fulfill the contract** on expiry.
    
- Can be used to **hedge risk** or **speculate**.
    

---

### 📍 **Options**

An **option** gives you the **right, but not the obligation**, to **buy (Call)** or **sell (Put)** an asset at a certain price.

#### ✅ Example:

You buy a call option to buy TCS at ₹3,500. If the price rises to ₹3,800, you can exercise your option and make a profit.

### 📝 Two Types:

- **Call Option**: Right to **buy**
    
- **Put Option**: Right to **sell**

## 🎯 Comparison Table:

|Feature|Equity|Debt|Commodity|Futures & Options|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ownership|Yes|No|No|No|
|Risk Level|Moderate–High|Low|High|High (leveraged)|
|Returns Type|Capital gain, dividend|Fixed interest|Speculative gain|Speculative, Hedging|
|Traded On|Stock Exchanges|Debt markets|Commodity exchanges|Derivatives segment|
|Time Horizon|Long-term|Short to medium|Short-term|Very short-term (days to months)|

---

## 🧠 In Simple Terms:

- **Equity** = Owning a slice of a company
    
- **Debt** = Lending money for interest
    
- **Commodity** = Trading physical goods like gold or oil
    
- **F&O** = Betting on future prices of assets (without owning them)

Let me know if you'd like real-world examples, investment tips, or how to get started in any of these!


No problem! Let’s break down **Futures and Options (F&O)** in **very simple terms**, with real-life examples. These are advanced tools, but I’ll make it as clear as possible.

---

## 🔴 What are **Futures and Options**?

They are types of **contracts** you can buy or sell in the stock market. You’re not buying the stock itself, but a **contract** based on it.

They let you:

- **Predict the future price** of a stock, index, or commodity
    
- **Make profits** if your prediction is right
    
- Or **protect your investment** from risk (called hedging)
    

---

## 📘 Start with a Story:

### Imagine:

You think **Tata Motors**, currently at ₹800, will go **up to ₹850** in one month.

You have two choices:

- ✅ Buy shares now and sell later (simple equity)
    
- 🔁 OR use **Futures or Options** to make money from your prediction.
    

Let’s now understand how each works:

---

## 🔵 1. **Futures – Think of it as a “promise to buy/sell later”**

### ✅ Example:

You enter a **Futures contract** to buy 100 shares of Tata Motors at ₹800 (today’s price), **one month later**.

- If price goes **up to ₹850** in a month:
    
    - You can still buy at ₹800 (your contract price) and **make ₹50 profit per share** = ₹5,000
        
- But if price goes **down to ₹750**:
    
    - You still have to buy at ₹800 and **lose ₹50 per share**
        

👉 In Futures, you are **obligated** to buy or sell at the contract price, even if it leads to loss.

---

## 🟠 2. **Options – Think of it as “insurance” or “right to buy/sell”**

Options give you a **choice**, not an obligation.

### There are two types:

- **Call Option** = Right to **Buy**
    
- **Put Option** = Right to **Sell**
    

---

### ✅ Call Option Example (You expect price will go UP):

You buy a **Call Option** to buy Tata Motors at ₹800 after 1 month.  
To get this right, you pay a **small fee (premium)** – let’s say ₹10 per share.

#### What can happen?

1. **If price goes to ₹850**:
    
    - You use your right and **buy at ₹800**, sell at ₹850, and profit:
        
        - ₹50 gain – ₹10 premium = ₹40 profit per share
            
2. **If price goes down to ₹750**:
    
    - You **don’t use** the option. Just lose the ₹10 premium.
        
    - Better than losing ₹50 like in Futures!
        

👉 In Options, you have the **choice to buy/sell**, but no compulsion.

---

### ✅ Put Option Example (You expect price will go DOWN):

Let’s say you buy a **Put Option** to sell Tata Motors at ₹800.

- If price drops to ₹750, you can **still sell at ₹800**, making profit.
    
- If price rises to ₹850, you **don’t sell**, just lose the small premium.

## 🟢 Summary Table

|Feature|Futures|Options|
|---|---|---|
|Obligation?|Yes, must buy/sell at expiry|No, only if you want|
|Risk|High (can lose big)|Lower (max loss = premium paid)|
|Upfront Cost|No premium, but margin needed|Pay small premium (like insurance fee)|
|Use Case|For confident predictions|For flexible and safer trading|
|Who uses it?|Traders, investors, hedgers|Same – especially to reduce risk|

---

## 🎯 In Simple Words:

- **Futures**: You **must** complete the deal at the decided price later, profit or loss.
    
- **Options**: You **can choose** to complete the deal, only if it's profitable.

## 1. Why should you invest?
Key Takeaways

1. Risk and Return go hand in hand. Higher the risk, higher the return. Lower the risk, lower is the return.

2. Invest in securing your future.

3. The corpus you intend to buiid at the end of the defined period is sensitive to the return rate the investment generates. A small variation to rate can have big impact on the corpus.

4. Choose an instrument that best suits your risk and return appetite.

5. Equity should be a part of your investment if you want to beat the inflation in the long run.

#   Why and how do companies list, and what is an IPO?
Here’s a refined summary in 8 bullet points, each with timestamps:

- **(00:00)** Introduction: Over 5,000 companies are listed on stock exchanges (e.g., BSE) and the video teases exploring why a company lists and how an IPO works.
    
- **(01:05)** Growth spotlight: Example company shows a 608% gross profit increase; highlights how strong growth attracts investors and motivates companies to go public.
    
- **(01:57)** Early fundraising stages: Companies typically raise money from friends, family, and high-net-worth individuals before considering an IPO for wider funding.
    
- **(03:06)** Transition to public: Once private fundraising slows, companies look to the public markets via an IPO (Initial Public Offering) to raise capital and meet investor demand.
    
- **(04:13)** IPO basics: Defines an IPO as offering shares to the public for the first time, enabling companies to raise funds beyond early investors and institutional backers.
    
- **(05:19)** IPO process overview: Involves filing registration statements, preparing prospectus, and providing disclosure about the company’s financial health and risks.
    
- **(06:22)** Marketing the IPO (“roadshow”): Underwriters and management pitch the company to potential investors to build awareness and gauge interest before price setting.
    
- **(07:15)** Listing and aftermarket: Shares are officially listed and trade based on supply and demand, potentially at a premium or discount, with stock prices fluctuating second-by-second in secondary markets.
    
Yes, exactly.

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Before the IPO (Private phase):**  
    The company is privately owned and raises funds through founders, friends, family, or private investors (like venture capitalists).
    
2. **IPO (Initial Public Offering):**  
    The company decides to "go public" by offering shares to the general public for the first time. These are **new shares** sold at a specific IPO price.
    
3. **IPO Allotment:**  
    Investors (retail, institutional, etc.) apply to buy shares during the IPO window. Shares are allotted based on demand.
    
4. **Listing on Stock Exchange:**  
    Once allotted, these IPO shares are **listed on the stock exchange** (like NSE or BSE in India). This is the company's **first trading day** as a public company.
    
5. **After Listing – Secondary Market:**  
    Now, those same IPO shares can be **freely bought and sold** by investors in the open market. This is called the **secondary market**. The price here is driven by **demand and supply**, not the IPO price.
    

So in summary:  
👉 The **IPO shares** are the initial batch sold by the company to raise capital.  
👉 Once listed, they become **tradable shares** on the stock exchange – this is where regular investors buy and sell them daily.


# [4. Why do stock prices fluctuate?](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/why-do-stock-prices-fluctuate/)

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways:**

- Stock prices are dynamic and change in **real-time**.
    
- Prices are influenced by **market demand and supply**, **company news**, and **investor sentiment**.
    
- Every investor's perception matters — even for the same stock.


# ## 6.7 – How to calculate returns?

Now, everything in markets boils down to one thing. Generating a reasonable rate of return! All past stock market sins are forgiven if your trade generates a good return. Returns are usually expressed in terms of annual yield. There are different kinds of returns that you need to be aware of. The following will give you a sense of what they are and how to calculate these returns.

**_Absolute Return_** – This is the return that your trade or investment generates in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?

The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100

i.e. [3550/3030 -1] *100

= 0.1716 * 100

= 17.16%

A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!

_**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** –_ An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030, held the stock for two years, and sold it at 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?

CAGR factors in the time component, which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.

The formula to calculate CAGR is…

![CAGR](http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR.jpg)

Applying this to answer the question…

{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%

This means the investment grew at a rate of 8.2% for two years. As of today, the bank fixed deposit market offers 5.5% with capital protection hence, 8.2% return looks ok compared to a fixed deposit.

So, always use CAGR to check returns over multiple years. Use absolute return when your time frame is for a year or lesser.

What if you bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within six months? In that case, you have generated 17.16% in 6 months, which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.

So the point is if you have to compare returns, it’s best done when the return is expressed on an annualized basis.

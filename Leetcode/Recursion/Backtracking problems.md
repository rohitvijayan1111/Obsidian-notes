𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗥𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻) is one of the topics where people struggle the most. But this is a super important topic to master for interviews. Here is a list of problems to solve to clear your concepts in backtracking.

Backtracking is a systematic algorithmic approach that explores all possible solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates and abandoning them as soon as it determines they cannot lead to a valid solution. Think of it as navigating through a maze where you try each path, and when you hit a dead end, you retrace your steps to the last decision point and try a different route. This technique is particularly powerful for constraint satisfaction problems where you need to find all valid configurations or arrangements.

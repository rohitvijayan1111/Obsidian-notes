I invested 3+ hours into this cheatsheet with 8 Dynamic Programming patterns and 24 LeetCode problems so that you can master DP. Learning to recognize these patterns will help you solve 90% of any DP problems you may come across in coding interviews  
  
1 // Basic Dynamic Programming  
  
→When to use:  
Use when you notice recursive solutions with overlapping subproblems and repeated calculations. Storing solutions to subproblems (memoization or tabulation) leads to major efficiency gains.  
  
→Where:  
Problems with redundant computations in recursion; optimal to store intermediate results.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→Fibonacci Number  
→Climbing Stairs  
→House Robber  
  
2 // Optimal Substructure  
  
→When to use:  
Use when the optimal solution can be built by combining optimal solutions to its subproblems.  
  
→Where:  
Problems where “breaking down” a big problem into smaller, similar problems leads to the overall solution.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→Maximum Subarray  
→Longest Increasing Subsequence  
→Coin Change

Most people struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic.  
But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong.  
  
If you want to solve problems fast and with solid accuracy, you need to think in patterns.  
  
Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview that you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck.  
  
That’s why I’ve put together this DSA Pattern Sheet, which helps you:  
✅ identify key patterns and learn when to apply them.  
✅ understand scenarios and clues that signal which approach to use.  
✅ practice with 5-6 leetcode problems per pattern to solidify learning.  
✅ cover 250-300 essential problems, ensuring you master every core concept.  
✅ customize the sheet to track progress and adapt it to your needs.

3 // Interval/Range DP  
  
→When to use:  
Use when the problem asks you to solve for intervals or ranges, and the answer for a range depends on its subranges.  
  
→Where:  
Problems that involve merging, splitting, or making choices over intervals or subarrays.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→Minimum Falling Path Sum  
→Burst Balloons  
→Strange Printer  
  
4 // Knapsack Problems  
  
→When to use:  
Use when you need to select items with weights/values to maximize/minimize some total without exceeding a limit.  
  
→Where:  
Problems with choices under constraints (like weight, capacity, budget).  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→0/1 Knapsack  
→Partition Equal Subset Sum  
→Target Sum  
  
5 // Prefix Sums  
  
→When to use:  
Use when you need to repeatedly compute sums or counts over subarrays/ranges, and want fast queries after some preprocessing.  
  
→Where:  
Problems that ask for sum, count, or aggregate in O(1) time after setup.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→Subarray Sum Equals K  
→Range Sum Query - Immutable  
→Count of Range Sum

6 // Counting Problems  
  
→When to use:  
Use when the goal is to count the number of ways to reach a result, subject to certain transitions or rules.  
  
→Where:  
Problems about counting combinations, arrangements, or ways to reach a state.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
  
→Unique Paths III  
→Distinct Subsequences  
→Count Numbers with Unique Digits  
  
7 // Interval Partitioning  
  
→When to use:  
Use when the problem asks you to split intervals into non-overlapping groups or minimize overlaps.  
  
→Where:  
Scheduling or grouping problems involving intervals.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
→Non-overlapping Intervals  
→Partition Labels  
→Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target  
  
8 // Probability & Expectations  
  
→When to use:  
Use when the problem asks for probabilities or expected values over a series of steps or decisions.  
  
→Where:  
Problems about finding the likelihood of outcomes or expected results in stochastic processes.  
  
∟Practice Problems:  
→Knight Probability in Chessboard  
→Dice Roll Simulation  
→Predict the Winner

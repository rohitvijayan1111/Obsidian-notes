# [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

Here's a clear breakdown of the **four approaches** to the **House Robber problem**, including your provided **shifted index top-down** version, each with its **code, explanation, and time complexity**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Recursive (Plain Recursion – No Memoization)**

#### 🔁 Idea:

- At each step, choose whether to rob the current house and skip the previous one (`n-2`), or skip the current house (`n-1`).
    
- Repeats many subproblems (exponential time).
    

#### 💡 Code:

```python
def rob_recursive(nums):
    def helper(n):
        if n < 0:
            return 0
        return max(nums[n] + helper(n - 2), helper(n - 1))
    return helper(len(nums) - 1)
```

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

**O(2^n)** – Exponential, because every call splits into two.

#### 🧠 Space Complexity:

**O(n)** (due to call stack depth)

---

### ✅ 2. **Top-Down (Memoization / Standard DP)**

#### 🔁 Idea:

- Same recursive logic, but store results in `dp[n]` to avoid recomputation.
    

#### 💡 Code:

```python
def rob_top_down(nums):
    dp = [-1] * len(nums)
    def helper(n):
        if n < 0:
            return 0
        if dp[n] != -1:
            return dp[n]
        dp[n] = max(nums[n] + helper(n - 2), helper(n - 1))
        return dp[n]
    return helper(len(nums) - 1)
```

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

**O(n)** – Each index is computed once.

#### 🧠 Space Complexity:

**O(n)** – For memoization array + recursion stack.

---

### ✅ 3. **Shifted Index Top-Down (Your Version)**

#### 🔁 Idea:

- Shift the indices by +1 to avoid negative indexing.
    
- Use `n == 0` and `n == 1` as base cases, and work up to `n == len(nums)`.
    

#### 💡 Code (fixed version):

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        dp = [-1] * (len(nums) + 1)
        def helper(n):
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            if n == 1:
                return nums[0]
            if dp[n] != -1:
                return dp[n]
            dp[n] = max(nums[n - 1] + helper(n - 2), helper(n - 1))
            return dp[n]
        return helper(len(nums))
```

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

**O(n)** – Each `helper(n)` is computed once and memoized.

#### 🧠 Space Complexity:

**O(n)** – For `dp` array and recursion stack.

---

### ✅ 4. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**

#### 🔁 Idea:

- Iteratively build the solution from the base cases.
    
- Avoid recursion completely.
    

#### 💡 Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1] = nums[0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = max(nums[i - 1] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1])
        return dp[n]
```

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

**O(n)** – Single pass over the array.

#### 🧠 Space Complexity:

**O(n)** – For `dp` array. Can be optimized to **O(1)** (space-optimized version).

---

### ✅ (Optional) 5. **Bottom-Up Space Optimized**

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        prev2, prev1 = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            curr = max(num + prev2, prev1)
            prev2, prev1 = prev1, curr
        return prev1
```

#### ⏱ Time: **O(n)**

#### 🧠 Space: **O(1)**

---

### 📊 Summary Table:

|Approach|Time Complexity|Space Complexity|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Recursive (plain)|O(2^n)|O(n)|Inefficient due to repeated subproblems|
|Top-Down (memoized)|O(n)|O(n)|Efficient, avoids recomputation|
|Shifted Index Top-Down|O(n)|O(n)|Same as top-down, cleaner indexing|
|Bottom-Up (tabulation)|O(n)|O(n)|Iterative, no recursion|
|Bottom-Up (space-opt)|O(n)|O(1)|Most efficient in terms of space|

# [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)


_Problem Statement Link:_ [_House Robber_](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/house-robber_839733?source=youtube&campaign=striver_dp_videos&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=striver_dp_videos)

A thief needs to rob money in a street. The houses in the street are arranged in a circular manner. Therefore the first and the last house are adjacent to each other. The security system in the street is such that if adjacent houses are robbed, the police will get notified.

Given an array of integers “Arr'' which represents money at each house, we need to return the maximum amount of money that the thief can rob without alerting the police.

**Examples**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XG1_bncXs9qY3NldqFW-79mYZLwA84HZSsG58UaQR63ZatUYlRlUQ-0vFsCaEmPxBik4c9xftsYnzMZdtAlweBpvTZ0I3BBm9ZD_IVFkB-HAr7NuSTgf4jgzQsKV6qpgQyPu20zW)

**Pre-req:** [**Maximum Sum of non-adjacent elements**](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/maximum-sum-of-non-adjacent-elements-dp-5/)

### **Solution :**

This question can be solved using the approach discussed in the [Maximum Sum of non-adjacent elements](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/maximum-sum-of-non-adjacent-elements-dp-5/). Readers are highly advised to go through that article first and then read this. The rest of the article will refer to the previous article as Article DP5 and will relate to that approach. 

Now, we have a single test case. Three houses have money as shown.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TQxjaokoYS4UBxXxGJlcSbVElkd46Mxc4w7tmg0I6-Tn8NKwa8HtaxZGDZkDAtd3oSIai0T2r8CJiu9d4foSWJbAaNmFNxG-divkVyFIrQA-5dVc85M0qSXDPcGkugjKsZvkwwIu)

- According to article DP5, the answer will be 4(2+2) as we are taking the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.
- In this question, the first and last element are also adjacent(circular street), therefore the answer will be 3.

**Modification to Article DP5’s Approach**

We were finding the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the previous questions. For a circular street, the first and last house are adjacent, therefore one thing we know for sure is that the answer will not consider the first and last element simultaneously (as they are adjacent).

Now building on the article DP5, we can say that maybe the last element is not considered in the answer. In that case, we can consider the first element. Let’s call this answer ans1. Hence we have reduced our array(arr- last element), say arr1, and found ans1 on it by using the article DP5 approach.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0mkwqypWCCVBzCR3p4y0kpIcfaOtXVj554Oppzazg3vz8R7BSgWstj6oIwKJtgmDVVZ7Ixn5I3q-KTAWMP3xWzQX88XoyrZBEZ7KcCH6T2IMGSserlmIDas4ZlI8OhMAe84kgL72)

Now, it can also happen that the final answer does consider the last element. If we consider the last element, we can’t consider the first element( again adjacent elements). We again use the same approach on our reduced array( arr - first element), say arr2. Let’s call the answer we get as ans2.

Now, the final answer can be either ans1 or ans2. As we have to return the maximum money robbed by the robber, we will return max(ans1, ans2) as our final answer.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0x1VzdE2zZniwJr84vvkNsZWQSeNsKu385q_o-ySKc7rdFGdj-Qhc7I6XSif0vldfl9NIfqEd92e7mlYkDc6Z05dgtO0pZX7Qg30W09hU7qOHFuzvvv0Sh8KgphfR5IZ2mVdFJqf)

**Approach:**

The approach to solving this problem can be summarized as:

- Make two reduced arrays - arr1(arr-last element) and arr2(arr-first element).
- Find the maximum of non-adjacent elements as mentioned in article DP5 on arr1 and arr2 separately. Let’s call the answers we got ans1 and ans2 respectively.
- Return max(ans1, ans2) as our final answer.

**Code:**

C++JavaPython

```python
def solve(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    prev = arr[0]
    prev2 = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        pick = arr[i]
        if i > 1:
            pick += prev2
        nonPick = 0 + prev

        cur_i = max(pick, nonPick)
        prev2 = prev
        prev = cur_i

    return prev
```

# [518. Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)


You're right — thanks for pointing that out! Here's the **complete and clean documentation** including all three main approaches:

1. **Recursion (Exponential)**
    
2. **Top-Down DP (Memoization)**
    
3. **Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation - 2D)**
    
4. **Space Optimized DP (1D)**
    

---

## 🪜 1. Recursive Solution (Brute Force)

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        def helper(target, ind):
            if target == 0:
                return 1  # One way to make amount 0 (choose nothing)
            if ind == 0:
                return 1 if target % coins[0] == 0 else 0

            include = 0
            if target - coins[ind] >= 0:
                include = helper(target - coins[ind], ind)  # Stay on same index
            not_include = helper(target, ind - 1)  # Move to previous index

            return include + not_include

        n = len(coins)
        return helper(amount, n - 1)
```

### ❗ Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time:** `O(2^n)` in worst case due to overlapping subproblems.
    
- **Space:** `O(amount)` for recursion stack depth.
    

---

## 🧠 2. Top-Down DP (Memoization)

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(coins)
        dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(amount + 1)]

        def helper(target, ind):
            if target == 0:
                return 1
            if ind == 0:
                return 1 if target % coins[0] == 0 else 0
            if dp[target][ind] != -1:
                return dp[target][ind]

            include = 0
            if target - coins[ind] >= 0:
                include = helper(target - coins[ind], ind)
            not_include = helper(target, ind - 1)

            dp[target][ind] = include + not_include
            return dp[target][ind]

        return helper(amount, n - 1)
```

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time:** `O(amount × n)` — due to memoization.
    
- **Space:** `O(amount × n)` for memo table + recursion stack.
    

---

## 📊 3. Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation — 2D)

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(coins)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(amount + 1)]

        # Base case: one way to make amount 0 (by taking nothing)
        for i in range(n):
            dp[0][i] = 1

        # Fill column 0: only using first coin
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 1 if i % coins[0] == 0 else 0

        for target in range(1, amount + 1):
            for ind in range(1, n):
                include = 0
                if target - coins[ind] >= 0:
                    include = dp[target - coins[ind]][ind]  # stay at same coin
                not_include = dp[target][ind - 1]  # move to previous coin
                dp[target][ind] = include + not_include

        return dp[amount][n - 1]
```

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time:** `O(amount × n)`
    
- **Space:** `O(amount × n)`
    

---

## 💡 4. Space Optimized DP (1D)

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to make 0

        for coin in coins:
            for target in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[target] += dp[target - coin]

        return dp[amount]
```

### 🧠 Why This Works:

- Process each coin fully before moving to the next.
    
- This ensures no repeated combinations in different order.
    
- `dp[target] += dp[target - coin]` accumulates ways using that coin.
    

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time:** `O(amount × n)`
    
- **Space:** `O(amount)`

# [Knapsack with Duplicate Items](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/knapsack-with-duplicate-items4201/1)


Absolutely! Here's a **complete, cleanly documented, and unified implementation** of the **Unbounded Knapsack Problem** in Python, covering all major approaches:

---

# 🧰 Problem: **Unbounded Knapsack**

Given:

- `val[]`: list of item values
    
- `wt[]`: corresponding list of item weights
    
- `capacity`: maximum weight the knapsack can hold
    

Goal:  
Maximize the **total value** such that any number of each item can be included (unbounded use allowed).

---

# ✅ Solution Approaches

## 🧩 1. Recursive (Brute Force)

```python
class Solution:
    def knapSack(self, val, wt, capacity):
        def helper(amount, ind):
            if amount == 0:
                return 0
            if ind == 0:
                return (amount // wt[0]) * val[0]  # Take as many as possible

            # Option 1: include current item (if it fits)
            inc = 0
            if amount - wt[ind] >= 0:
                inc = val[ind] + helper(amount - wt[ind], ind)  # Stay on same index

            # Option 2: skip current item
            not_inc = helper(amount, ind - 1)

            return max(inc, not_inc)

        n = len(wt)
        return helper(capacity, n - 1)
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** Exponential (due to overlapping subproblems)
    
- **Space:** `O(capacity)` recursion stack depth
    

---

## 🧠 2. Top-Down DP (Memoization)

```python
class Solution:
    def knapSack(self, val, wt, capacity):
        n = len(wt)
        dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(capacity + 1)]

        def helper(amount, ind):
            if amount == 0:
                return 0
            if ind == 0:
                return (amount // wt[0]) * val[0]
            if dp[amount][ind] != -1:
                return dp[amount][ind]

            inc = 0
            if amount - wt[ind] >= 0:
                inc = val[ind] + helper(amount - wt[ind], ind)

            not_inc = helper(amount, ind - 1)

            dp[amount][ind] = max(inc, not_inc)
            return dp[amount][ind]

        return helper(capacity, n - 1)
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n × capacity)`
    
- **Space:** `O(n × capacity)` for memo table + recursion stack
    

---

## 📊 3. Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation — 2D)

```python
class Solution:
    def knapSack(self, val, wt, capacity):
        n = len(wt)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(capacity + 1)]

        # Fill base cases
        for w in range(capacity + 1):
            dp[w][0] = (w // wt[0]) * val[0]

        for amount in range(1, capacity + 1):
            for ind in range(1, n):
                inc = 0
                if amount - wt[ind] >= 0:
                    inc = val[ind] + dp[amount - wt[ind]][ind]
                not_inc = dp[amount][ind - 1]
                dp[amount][ind] = max(inc, not_inc)

        return dp[capacity][n - 1]
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n × capacity)`
    
- **Space:** `O(n × capacity)`
    

---

## 💾 4. Bottom-Up DP (Space Optimized — 1D)

```python
class Solution:
    def knapSack(self, val, wt, capacity):
        n = len(wt)
        dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)

        for i in range(n):
            for w in range(wt[i], capacity + 1):
                dp[w] = max(dp[w], val[i] + dp[w - wt[i]])

        return dp[capacity]
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n × capacity)`
    
- **Space:** `O(capacity)` — space-optimized
    

---

## 📝 Example

```python
val = [6, 1, 7, 7]
wt = [1, 3, 4, 5]
capacity = 8

Solution().knapSack(val, wt, capacity)  # Output: 48
```

**Why 48?**  
You can take item 0 (value 6, weight 1) eight times → `6 × 8 = 48`.

---

## 📋 Summary of Approaches

|Approach|Time Complexity|Space Complexity|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Recursive|Exponential|O(capacity)|Brute force, slow|
|Top-Down (Memoization)|O(n × capacity)|O(n × capacity)|Caches overlapping subproblems|
|Bottom-Up (2D)|O(n × capacity)|O(n × capacity)|Classic tabulation|
|Bottom-Up (1D)|O(n × capacity)|**O(capacity)**|Best for performance|

                dp[l] = max(dp[l], p + dp[l - length_of_cut])

        return dp[n]
```

---

## 🧠 Time & Space Complexity

|Approach|Time Complexity|Space Complexity|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Recursive**|O(2ⁿ)|O(n) (stack)|Very inefficient for large `n`|
|**2D DP (Tabulation)**|O(n²)|O(n²)|Fills a table of size (n+1)×n|
|**1D DP (Optimized)**|**O(n²)**|**O(n)**|Best approach for this problem|

---

## 🔍 Example

```python
price = [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
Solution().cutRod(price)  # Output: 24
```

Explanation:

- Best cuts for rod of length 8: two cuts of length 2 (price 5) and two cuts of length 2 → total = 4×5 = 20
    
- But better is: 6 + 2 → 17 + 5 = 22
    
- Or: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 → 4×5 = 20
    
- **Best**: 2×1 + 6 → 2×3 + 17 = **23**
    
- **Best overall**: 2×1 + 6 = 3 + 3 + 17 = **23**, or some other combo reaching **24** depending on values
    

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

Use the **1D DP approach** for production or competitive programming:

- It retains the time efficiency of tabulation
    
- Saves space from `O(n²)` to `O(n)`
    
- Easy to implement and extend
    

Let me know if you'd like to also **return the cuts used**, or print all combinations that yield the max value!

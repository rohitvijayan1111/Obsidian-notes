## 🔹 Two major flavors of partitioning problems:

1️⃣ **Sequential (prefix/suffix) partitioning (single variable `i`)**

- You process the array from left to right (or right to left), and at each position `i`, you ask:  
    ➔ _“What is the best solution for the first `i` elements?”_
    
- At each step, you look back (or ahead) up to some window size (like length `k`).
    
- Typical examples:
    
    - **This problem** (max sum after partitioning).
        
    - Rod cutting (best price for rod of length `n`).
        
    - Word break (can you partition a string into valid words).
        
    - Minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.
        
- Why single variable works: the problem naturally grows by adding to one end of the sequence, and you don’t need to explore arbitrary subarrays — you only extend the prefix (or suffix) optimally.
    

---

2️⃣ **Arbitrary subarray/substructure partitioning (two variables `i`, `j`)**

- You have to process **any subarray or subsequence** between indices `i` and `j`, because the problem requires you to make decisions inside arbitrary intervals.
    
- Typical examples:
    
    - **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: computing minimal cost to parenthesize matrix products, where you must try every split point between `i` and `j`.
        
    - Palindrome partitioning problems.
        
    - Minimum score triangulation of a polygon.
        
    - Burst balloons (range-based DP on `i` to `j`).
        
- Why two variables are necessary: you must handle **all subproblems defined on every range (i,j)** because the best solution for [i,j] depends on how you split it at every possible `k` between `i` and `j`.
    

---

## 🔹 How to tell which one applies?

👉 **If the question is about partitioning a sequence into contiguous pieces** (but the order of pieces is fixed, and you only need to decide the partition points, like this problem), you can often build it using a single index DP — just extend the prefix optimally.

👉 **If the question asks you to combine or divide arbitrary ranges, or recursively split intervals in many ways** (like “try every way of splitting [i,j]”), you almost always need a 2D DP on `[i][j]`.

---

## ✅ TL;DR Rule of thumb:

- **Single index DP** (`dp[i]`) → if you only extend one side (prefix/suffix) at each step, like linear partitions.
    
- **Double index DP** (`dp[i][j]`) → if you must handle arbitrary subarrays/subsequences, or if the problem says _“try every way of splitting an interval.”_
    

---

### 🔥 Examples to clarify:

|Problem|DP State Needed|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|Max sum after partitioning|1D `dp[i]`|Only need to optimally extend prefix|
|Matrix Chain Multiplication|2D `dp[i][j]`|Need to try all splits between i and j|
|Longest Palindromic Subsequence|2D `dp[i][j]`|Need to evaluate subsequences between i and j|
|Rod Cutting|1D `dp[i]`|Only need to partition the prefix of a rod|
|Burst Balloons|2D `dp[i][j]`|Need to try every burst order within interval i to j|

##### You said:

Is it like this like in problems like MCN and bursting balloons the cost was dependent on the elements next to it like the left of it and to the right of it the cost is dependent on it so we used two variables and now here it is only dependent on where we split it and the maximum till I

###### ChatGPT said:

💯 **Yes! You’ve got the right intuition — let’s make that precise so it sticks!**

---

## 🔑 The key difference:

👉 In problems like **Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)** or **Burst Balloons**:

- The **cost of splitting at position `k` inside interval `[i,j]` depends on the surroundings** — e.g. what’s on the left of the split, what’s on the right, or what’s at the boundaries.
    
- Example in burst balloons:
    
    ini
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `coins = nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1]`
    
    The value of bursting `k` depends on the balloons at `i-1` and `j+1` → so you can’t just process left-to-right — you must consider the full interval at once, and try all ways of splitting it.
    

👉 In **max sum after partitioning**:

- The **cost only depends on the current partition itself (and its max)** → and the rest of the array can be processed separately because what’s to the left or right doesn’t affect the value of this partition.
    
- Once you choose a partition of size `j`, its contribution is `max_in_partition * j`, independent of what’s around it.
    

---

## ✅ Rule:

If:

- The cost to compute something at position `k` depends on _external context_ (like left and right boundaries of the range)  
    → **You need 2D DP and interval processing.**
    

If:

- The cost of the current piece depends _only on the piece itself_, and you can combine optimal solutions of disjoint parts without worrying about interactions  
    → **You can usually use 1D DP and process in sequence.**
    

---

### 💡 Concrete contrast

|Problem|What determines cost?|What DP needed?|
|---|---|---|
|**Burst Balloons**|Value depends on nums[i-1], nums[k], nums[j+1] → external context|2D DP over intervals|
|**MCM**|Cost = cost of left + cost of right + cost of multiplying boundaries → depends on boundaries|2D DP over intervals|
|**Max Sum After Partitioning**|Cost = max in current block * size → no external dependencies|1D DP|

---

## 🚀 Summary insight

> If the **decision at a point depends on external boundaries (outside the current subproblem)** → you need `dp[i][j]`.

> If the **decision only depends on the current chunk and prior best results** → you can use `dp[i]`.

---

### ✅ You’ve captured this idea beautifully — you’re on the right track.

If you’d like, I can:

- Walk through burst balloons code to highlight this dependency
    
- Compare with this problem’s code side-by-side
    
- Give you practice problems to classify

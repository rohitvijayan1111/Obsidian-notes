[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecae672-60ea-4c0c-800e-4affcb75585b_1456x902.webp)



](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecae672-60ea-4c0c-800e-4affcb75585b_1456x902.webp)

Prefix Sum involves **preprocessing** an array to create a new array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to `i`. This allows for efficient **sum queries on subarrays**.

Use this pattern when you need to perform multiple sum queries on a subarray or need to calculate cumulative sums.

#### Sample Problem:

Given an array `nums`, answer multiple queries about the sum of elements within a specific range `[i, j]`.

**Example**:

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `i = 1`, `j = 3`
    
- **Output:** `9`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Preprocess the array `A` to create a prefix sum array: `P = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]`.
    
2. To find the sum between indices `i` and `j`, use the formula: `P[j] - P[i-1]`.

The Two Pointers pattern involves using two pointers to iterate through an array or list, often used to find **pairs or elements** that meet specific criteria.

Use this pattern when dealing with sorted arrays or lists where you need to find pairs that satisfy a specific condition.

#### Sample Problem:

Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target value.

**Example**:

- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, `target = 6`
    
- Output: `[1, 3]`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Initialize two pointers, one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
    
2. Check the sum of the elements at the two pointers.
    
3. If the sum equals the target, return the indices.
    
4. If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right.
    
5. If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left.

The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

#### Sample Problem:

Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

**Example**:

- Input: `nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`, `k = 3`
    
- Output: `9`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Start with the sum of the first `k` elements.
    
2. Slide the window one element at a time, subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element.
    
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fffe0ba-4cb5-4bb0-8973-fd8236d4fcf8_1456x931.webp)

The Overlapping Intervals pattern is used to merge or handle overlapping intervals in an array.

In an interval array sorted by **start time**, two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` overlap if `b >= c` (i.e., the end time of the first interval is greater than or equal to the start time of the second interval).

#### Sample Problem:

**Problem Statement**: Merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example**:

- Input: `intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`
    
- Output: `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Sort the intervals by their start time.
    
2. Create an empty list called `merged` to store the merged intervals.
    
3. Iterate through the intervals and check if it overlaps with the last interval in the `merged` list.
    
4. If it overlaps, merge the intervals by updating the end time of the last interval in `merged`.
    
5. If it does not overlap, simply add the current interval to the `merged` list.
    

#### LeetCode Problems:

1. [Merge Intervals (LeetCode #56)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
    
2. [Insert Interval (LeetCode #57)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/)

The Modified Binary Search pattern adapts binary search to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding elements in rotated sorted arrays.

Use this pattern for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays where you need to find a specific element.

#### Sample Problem:

Find an element in a rotated sorted array.

**Example**:

- Input: `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`
    
- Output: `4`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Perform binary search with an additional check to determine which half of the array is sorted.
    
2. We then check if the target is within the range of the sorted half.
    
3. If it is, we search that half; otherwise, we search the other half.

Binary Tree Traversal involves visiting all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order.

- **PreOrder**: `root -> left -> right`
    
- **InOrder**: `left -> root -> right`
    
- **PostOrder**: `left -> right -> root`
    

#### Sample Problem:

**Problem Statement**: Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree.

**Example**:

- Input: `root = [1, null, 2, 3]`
    
- Output: `[1, 3, 2]`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Inorder traversal visits nodes in the order: left, root, right.
    
2. Use recursion or a stack to traverse the tree in this order.

Backtracking explores all possible solutions and backtracks when a solution path fails.

Use this pattern when you need to find all (or some) solutions to a problem that satisfies given constraints. For example: combinatorial problems, such as generating permutations, combinations, or subsets.

#### Sample Problem:

Generate all permutations of a given list of numbers.

**Example**:

- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
    
- **Output:** `[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]`
    

#### Explanation:

1. Use recursion to generate permutations.
    
2. For each element, include it in the current permutation and recursively generate the remaining permutations.
    
3. Backtrack when all permutations for a given path are generated.
    

#### LeetCode Problems:

1. [Permutations (LeetCode #46)](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)
    
2. [Subsets (LeetCode #78)](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)
    
3. [N-Queens (LeetCode #51)](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)

Dynamic Programming (DP) involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

Use this pattern for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

DP itself has multiple sub-patterns. Some of the most important ones are:

- Fibonacci Numbers
    
- 0/1 Knapsack
    
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
    
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
    
- Subset Sum
    
- Matrix Chain Multiplication

#### Sample Problem:

Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

**Example**:

- Input: `n = 5`
    
- Output: `5` (The first five Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
    

#### Explanation:

1. Use a bottom-up approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.
    
2. Start with the first two numbers (0 and 1) and iterate to calculate the next numbers like `(dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])`.

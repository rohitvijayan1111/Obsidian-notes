These are the 12 patterns that cover 95% of all String and Heap problems in coding interviews.  
  
I've been teaching students and professionals for 8+ years now a nd I can say this with full confidence, string and heap-based problems show up in interviews at almost every top company. Google. Microsoft. Amazon. Juspay. Flipkart. You name it.  
  
If you want to master them, here’s how to start:  
  
► 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗣𝗔𝗧𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗡𝗦  
  
1/ Two Pointers

—Valid Palindrome→[https://lnkd.in/evA6W5Nf](https://lnkd.in/evA6W5Nf)  
—Reverse Words in a String→[https://lnkd.in/e9ezwk4E](https://lnkd.in/e9ezwk4E)  
—Longest Palindromic Substring→[https://lnkd.in/eS2J9eFn](https://lnkd.in/eS2J9eFn)  
  
2/ Sliding Window  
Use for finding substrings with dynamic properties (length, frequency.  
  
—Minimum Window Substring→[https://lnkd.in/eCcc5bPW](https://lnkd.in/eCcc5bPW)  
—Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters→[https://lnkd.in/ekhJ5fPW](https://lnkd.in/ekhJ5fPW)  
—Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters→[https://lnkd.in/ezaxRCdu](https://lnkd.in/ezaxRCdu)  
  
3/ Hashmaps

—Reverse String→[https://lnkd.in/eQWyVC8h](https://lnkd.in/eQWyVC8h)  
—String to Integer (atoi→[https://lnkd.in/eEwkvS27](https://lnkd.in/eEwkvS27)  
—Count and Say→[https://lnkd.in/ez62RhHa](https://lnkd.in/ez62RhHa)  
  
Most people struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic.  
But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong.  
  
If you want to solve problems fast and with solid accuracy, you need to think in patterns.  
  
Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview that you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck.  
  
That’s why I’ve put together this DSA Pattern Sheet, which helps you:  
✅ identify key patterns and learn when to apply them.  
✅ understand scenarios and clues that signal which approach to use.  
✅ practice with 5-6 leetcode problems per pattern to solidify learning.  
✅ cover 250-300 essential problems, ensuring you master every core concept.  
✅ customize the sheet to track progress and adapt it to your needs.

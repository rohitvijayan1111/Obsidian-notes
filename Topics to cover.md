Would you like me to also send you a **tiered roadmap** ‚Äî like "**easy ‚Üí medium ‚Üí hard**" progression for these topics? üìà  
		(Makes it super simple to plan your study.) üéØ


Here‚Äôs your roadmap üëá  
  
1. Sliding Window  
= When you need to find subarrays or substrings in a linear DS (like arrays or strings) that meet a certain condition  
_ Used in problems like: longest subarray, max sum of k-length window, etc.  
  
2. Two Pointers  
= For sorted arrays/strings where you move 2 pointers to meet a condition  
_ Used in: pair sums, palindrome checks, merging sorted arrays  
  
Also, I will be teaching DSA in my upcoming Gen AI + DSA Cohort,  
which is starting on 29th April.  
- It‚Äôs a 6-month-long live course  
- free access to LLD recordings  
- be ready with the Gen AI module I‚Äôve added this time  
- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineers  
  
The early offer is live, check it out here: [https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh](https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh)  
  
3. Modified Binary Search  
= Classic binary search but adapted for rotated arrays, infinite search space, or conditions beyond equality  
_ Used in: search in rotated array, peak element, kth element in sorted matrix  
  
4. Subset/Backtracking  
= When you need to generate all combinations or permutations  
_ Used in: subsets, combinations, permutations, N-Queens  
  
5. Top-K Elements  
= When you need to find the k smallest/largest items efficiently  
_ Always think heaps/priority queues here  
  
6. DFS/BFS on Trees  
= To explore all nodes in a tree, depth-first (recursion) or level-by-level (queues)  
_ Used in: max depth, level order traversal, path sums  
  
7. Topological Sort  
= Used in Directed Acyclic Graphs when there's dependency (prerequisite) between nodes  
_ Common in: course scheduling, task ordering  
  
8. Dynamic Programming  
= The final boss. For overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure  
_ Used in: knapsack, DP on strings, grid paths, longest subsequences

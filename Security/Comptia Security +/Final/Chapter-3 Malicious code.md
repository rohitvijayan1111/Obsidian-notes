## üß® **Trojans & Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**

### üîç **What is a Trojan?**

- A **Trojan** is malicious software disguised as a legitimate application.
    
- It **doesn‚Äôt replicate** like a virus or worm.
    
- It tricks users into **installing or running** it, then performs malicious actions in the background.
    

---

### üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è **What is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan)?**

- A special type of Trojan that **provides remote control** to an attacker.
    
- Acts like **legitimate remote access tools** (e.g., TeamViewer, AnyDesk).
    
- Often gives full access: file browsing, webcam/microphone access, keystroke logging, and more.
    
- **Hard to detect**, especially when attackers use known tools or legitimate-looking apps.
## üõ°Ô∏è **How Trojans and RATs Are Detected and Mitigated**

### üîê **Detection Techniques**

|Tool/Method|Role|
|---|---|
|**Antivirus/Antimalware**|Signature-based detection of known malware|
|**EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)**|Behavioral monitoring, anomaly detection|
|**Network Monitoring**|Detects C2 (Command & Control) traffic or strange DNS queries|
|**Application Control**|Restricts what users can install or run|
|**Heuristics & Sandboxing**|Detects suspicious behavior even in unknown files|

---

### üßØ **Mitigation Techniques**

|Practice|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Security Awareness Training**|Educate users not to download apps from untrusted sources|
|**Application Whitelisting**|Only allow approved apps to be installed|
|**Restrict Admin Privileges**|Prevent users from installing software or modifying system settings|
|**Use official app stores**|Third-party apps pose greater risk|
|**Regular Software Updates**|Patch vulnerabilities that RATs exploit|
|**Monitor false positives cautiously**|Avoid disabling detection of legitimate tools used as RATs|


### üõ°Ô∏è What is **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)?**

**EDR** is a **security solution** that monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to threats on **endpoint devices** (like laptops, desktops, and servers). It goes beyond traditional antivirus by focusing on **behavior, visibility, and response**.

## ü™± **Worms: Self-Spreading Malware**

### üìå **Definition**

A **worm** is a type of **malware** that can **replicate and spread on its own**‚Äî**without any user interaction**. Unlike Trojans, which require users to execute them, worms **automatically infect systems** using vulnerabilities, insecure configurations, or removable media.

---

## üß¨ **How Worms Spread**

Worms use **automated mechanisms** to move between systems, such as:

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**Network Exploits**|Exploits vulnerabilities in services (e.g., SMB, RDP)|
|**Email Attachments**|Sends itself via email and auto-executes on vulnerable clients|
|**File Shares**|Propagates across shared folders or mapped drives|
|**Removable Media**|Infects USB drives (e.g., Raspberry Robin, Stuxnet)|
|**IoT & Phones**|Exploits weak configurations or unpatched firmware|

Because worms **self-install and self-replicate**, they can spread **rapidly and widely** without human help.

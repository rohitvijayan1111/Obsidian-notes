- Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people through a variety of strategies to accomplish desired actions. 
- Social engineers work to influence their targets to take actions that they might not otherwise have taken.

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?

**Social engineering** is when an attacker **tricks or manipulates people** into doing something — usually something they **shouldn’t do**, like giving up a password, clicking a malicious link, or transferring money.

Instead of hacking computers, they **hack human behavior**.

## 🧩 Core Principles of Social Engineering:

Attackers use **psychological tricks** to influence decisions. Here are the most common techniques:

| Principle                    | How it Works                                     | Example                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authority**                | People tend to obey figures of authority.        | “I’m from the IT department. I need your login to fix an urgent issue.”     |
| **Intimidation**             | Scare or pressure the victim.                    | “If you don’t verify your identity now, your account will be disabled.”     |
| **Consensus / Social Proof** | People follow what others are doing.             | “Everyone in your team already filled out this form — you're the last one.” |
| **Scarcity**                 | People fear missing out on something limited.    | “Only two gift cards left — claim now or lose them forever!”                |
| **Familiarity**              | Exploit something that feels normal or friendly. | Pretending to be from a known brand like Microsoft or Amazon.               |
| **Trust**                    | Build a relationship to gain confidence.         | Chatting over time, acting helpful, then asking for a favor (like access).  |
| **Urgency**                  | Rush the victim to act before thinking.          | “Your account was compromised! You must reset your password now.”           |

## 🎭 Real-World Example:

An attacker might combine **multiple tricks** in one attack:

> “Hi, this is Emma from HR (familiarity). I’m calling on behalf of the Director (authority). She urgently needs your help (urgency), and if we don’t fix this today, your project might be in trouble (intimidation). Everyone else has already submitted their details (consensus).”

This kind of **layered approach** increases the chance the victim will comply.

## 🧠 Why It Works:

- It **targets emotions**: fear, trust, curiosity, stress.
    
- It **bypasses logic** by triggering **automatic human responses**.
    
- It’s effective because **humans are often the weakest link** in security.
    

---

## 🔐 How to Defend Against Social Engineering:

- Be **skeptical of urgent or emotional requests**.
    
- **Verify identities** independently (e.g., call the real HR or IT).
    
- Don’t click suspicious links or attachments.
    
- Get regular **security awareness training**.
    
- Use **multifactor authentication** so that even if a password is stolen, access is blocked.

If you want, I can create a cheat sheet or flashcards to help memorize these tactics easily.

### ✅ **What is Vishing?**

**Vishing** (short for **voice phishing**) is a type of **social engineering attack** conducted over the **phone or voicemail**.

The attacker pretends to be a **trusted authority** (like a bank, government agent, or company executive) and uses **deception and pressure** to trick the victim into giving up:

- Personal information (like SSNs, account numbers)
    
- Financial information (like credit card or banking details)
    
- Company info or access credentials
    
- Direct money transfers (e.g., wire fraud)
    

---

### 📞 **How Vishing Works**

1. **The attacker calls or leaves a voicemail**, pretending to be:
    
    - A bank or credit card company
        
    - A government agency (e.g., IRS or police)
        
    - A relative or friend in trouble
        
    - A company executive needing help
        
2. **They create urgency or fear** to make the victim act quickly:
    
    - “You’ll be arrested if you don’t respond now.”
        
    - “There’s fraud on your account; verify your info immediately.”
        
    - “Your boss needs you to wire money now while they're in a meeting.”
        
3. **They ask for sensitive data or push you to take action**, such as:
    
    - Giving personal or financial info
        
    - Downloading a malicious file or app
        
    - Sending money or gift cards

### 🎯 **Common Vishing Scams**

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Friend/relative in distress**|Claims someone you know is in trouble and needs money immediately.|
|**Tax scams**|Pretends to be from IRS or tax agency, threatening legal action.|
|**Police/law enforcement**|Says you’re under investigation or a warrant exists for your arrest.|
|**CEO fraud / executive scam**|Requests urgent action “on behalf of your boss” (e.g., wire money, buy gift cards).|

### 🛡️ **Defense Against Vishing**

1. **Don’t share personal info over the phone**, especially if **you didn’t initiate** the call.
    
2. **Hang up and verify** the caller using official contact info.
    
3. Be cautious of **urgent requests** or **pressure tactics**.
    
4. **Educate staff** about these scams (especially executives and finance teams).
    
5. Use **caller ID screening** and **block suspicious numbers**.
    
6. Consider tools like **voice biometrics** or **call verification services** in sensitive organizations.

### 🔑 **Key Concepts for Exams (like Security+)**

- Vishing = **voice-based** phishing.
    
- Relies heavily on **authority**, **urgency**, and **fear**.
    
- Often involves **immediate action** or **personal info disclosure**.
    
- Part of broader **social engineering** threats.

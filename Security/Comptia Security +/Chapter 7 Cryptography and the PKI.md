- Cryptography is the practice of encoding information in a manner that it cannot be decoded without access to the required decryption key.
- Cryptography consists of two main operations: encryption, which transforms plain-text information into ciphertext using an encryption key, and decryption, which transforms ciphertext back into plain text using a decryption key


Cryptography has several important goals
- confidentiality
- integrity
- authentication,
- nonrepudiation



A cipher is a method used to scramble or obfuscate characters to hide their value. Ciphering is the process of using a cipher to do that type of scrambling to a message.

The two primary types of nonmathematical cryptography, or ciphering methods, are 
- substitution and 
- transposition.

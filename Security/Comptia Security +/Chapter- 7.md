- Cryptography is the practice of encoding information in a manner that it cannot be decoded without access to the required decryption key.
- ciphertext ->  the text that is  encrypted.


- nonrepudiation, ensures that individuals can prove to a third party that a message came from its purported sender
- A cipher is a method used to scramble or obfuscate characters to hide their value.

Substitution Ciphers

- A substitution cipher is a type of coding or ciphering system that changes one character or symbol into another
- **Caesar cipher Substitution**. It was purportedly used by Julius Caesar. The system involves simply shifting all letters a certain number of spaces in the alphabet
- ROT13
	ROT13, or “rotate 13,” is another simple substitution cipher. The ROT13 cipher works the same way as the Caesar cipher but rotates every letter 13 places in the alphabet. 
-  **Polyalphabetic Substitution**
	- **Polyalphabetic substitution** improves security by using **multiple substitution alphabets** instead of just one.
	-  or example, you might shift the first letter by three to the right, the second letter by two to the right, and the third letter by one to the left

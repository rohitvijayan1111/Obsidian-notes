### üîê **Identity: What It Is**

In cybersecurity, an **identity** represents a **set of claims** made about a **subject**.

### üí° Who or What is a Subject?

A **subject** is anything that can be authenticated:

- **People** (users)
    
- **Applications**
    
- **Devices** (e.g., laptops, phones)
    
- **Systems** (e.g., servers)
    
- **Organizations** (e.g., identity federation partners)
    

When someone logs in to a system, they assert (claim) their identity‚Äîthis is where **identity management** begins.

---

### üßæ **Attributes vs. Traits**

An **identity** usually includes **attributes** and sometimes **traits**:

|**Attributes** (Changeable)|**Traits** (Inherent)|
|---|---|
|Job title|Eye color|
|Address|Place of birth|
|Phone number|Height|

- **Attributes** can be **updated** over time (e.g., someone moves, gets promoted).
    
- **Traits** tend to be **permanent** or hard to change.
    

---

### ü™™ **Ways to Claim (Assert) Identity**

To "claim" an identity, a subject uses one of several **identity assertion mechanisms**. These **do not prove** the identity‚Äî**they just claim it**. Proof comes later via **authentication**.

### 1. **Username**

- The most common way.
    
- Used to say "I am this person."
    
- On its own, a username is **not** an authentication factor.
    

### 2. **Certificates**

- Often used for **devices** and **systems**, but can also identify users.
    
- These are **digital files** that include identity information and are **cryptographically signed**.
    
- Example: SSL certificates on websites.
    

### 3. **Tokens**

- Physical devices like:
    
    - RSA key fobs (generate codes)
        
    - USB tokens (e.g., YubiKeys)
        
    - Bluetooth-based tokens (e.g., security keys for mobile devices)
        
- Used for **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) or certificate storage.
    

### 4. **SSH Keys**

- Widely used in DevOps and server access.
    
- Replace traditional username/passwords.
    
- A pair of keys: **public key** (shared) and **private key** (kept secret).
    
- Public key lives on the server; private key is used by the user to authenticate.
    

### 5. **Smartcards**

- Have embedded **secure chips**.
    
- Can store certificates and even **generate cryptographic key pairs**.
    
- Types:
    
    - **Contact** (inserted into a reader)
        
    - **Contactless** (tap or wave)
        
    - **Hybrid** (support both)
        

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Concerns: Key Pairs**

Key pairs (like those used in SSH or smartcards) are **sensitive and powerful**. If exposed, attackers can impersonate users or systems.

### üîê Risks

- **Private keys uploaded** to public repositories (like GitHub).
    
- Using **weak or blank passphrases** for SSH private keys.
    
- Storing key material in **unprotected locations**.
    

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Never upload private keys publicly.
    
- Always **encrypt private keys** with a strong passphrase.
    
- **Smartcards** that **generate keys onboard** are preferred‚Äîthey **don‚Äôt allow copying the private key**, making them more secure.

### Summary

| **Concept** | **Key Idea**                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Identity    | A set of claims about a subject |
| Subject     | Entity like a user or system    |
| Attributes  | Change                          |

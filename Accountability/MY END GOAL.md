### **Daily Commitment Plan**

To achieve my goals, I commit to the following lifestyle:

- **Sleep**: 6 solid hours every night for optimal recovery and productivity.
    
- **Work & Study**: Maximize the rest of my day with focused, productive work aligned with my goals (cybersecurity, startup planning, fitness, etc.).
    
- **Leisure & Self-Care**: Limit unstructured time to 1–2 hours per day, including:
    
    - Three healthy meals
        
    - Bathing and hygiene
        
    - Watching **productive YouTube content** or light entertainment that adds value

### **Guiding Principle**

**Level up by aligning every action with my long-term vision.** Every hour is either an investment in my success or a cost I must be willing to justify.



Every minute you waste now is a minute stolen from the man you dream of becoming — rich, respected, unstoppable. He’s waiting for you, but he won’t wait forever.

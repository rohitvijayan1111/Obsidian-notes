yesterday was really a big day for me . as i felt like my skills are back and did some proper study sessions.

Morning from 4 AM- 7 learnt cyber security. after which i went to college and met my friends after a long time. even though i spent long time roaming around to get my new ID (since i had changed from hostellers to dayscholar) . Actaully i had kept my old id in my house , so had to write letter for the same.

i college i pretty much solved only two problems. 

after that i reached home by 4:20 and then went for a bath. 
5:00-7:30 prepared for system design

7:30-8:30- went out for dinner

studied 1 hr dsa , and slept half way.

There are two major components that make up a website:

1. Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
2. Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

There are many other processes involved in your browser making a request to a web server, but for now, you just need to understand that you make a request to a server, and it responds with data your browser uses to render information to you.



# HTML


- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardisation across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
